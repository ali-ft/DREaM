"To delve deeper into the mechanistic aspects, we conducted chemogenetic activation experiments on LC Norepinephrine neurons with two doses of Clozapine N-oxide (CNO)",Norepinephrine,Clozapine,Component-Whole,cause-effect,Indole induces anxiety-like behaviour in mice mediated by brainstem locus coeruleus activation.,"The gut microbiota produces metabolites that enrich the host metabolome and play a part in host physiology, including brain functions. Yet the biological mediators of this gut-brain signal transduction remain largely unknown. In this study, the possible role of the gut microbiota metabolite indole, originating from tryptophan, was investigated. Oral administration of indole to simulate microbial overproduction of this compound in the gut consistently led to impaired locomotion and anxiety-like behaviour in both C3H/HeN and C57BL/6J mice. By employing c-Fos protein expression mapping in mice, we observed a noticeable increase in brain activation within the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMX) and the locus coeruleus (LC) regions in a dose-dependent manner. Further immune co-labelling experiments elucidated that the primary cells activated within the LC were tyrosine hydroxylase positive. To delve deeper into the mechanistic aspects, we conducted chemogenetic activation experiments on LC norepinephrine neurons with two doses of clozapine N-oxide (CNO). Low dose of CNO at 0.5 mg/kg induced no change in locomotion but anxiety-like behaviour, while high dose of CNO at 2 mg/kg resulted in locomotion impairment and anxiety-like behaviour. These findings support the neuroactive roles of indole in mediating gut-brain communication. It also highlights the LC as a novel hub in the gut-brain axis, encouraging further investigations.",10.1016/j.nbd.2024.106606
"Moreover, ultrasonication enhanced the amounts of essential Amino acids, including Glutamic acid, alanine, and glycine as well as the free amino acid content, which gives meat its savory and umami flavor",Amino acids,Glutamic acid,Component-Whole,component-whole,"Enhancing chicken breast meat quality through ultrasonication: Physicochemical, palatability, and amino acid profiles.","Ultrasonication, a technology that employs high-frequency sound waves, has demonstrated potential for modifying the properties of various food items. However, the effect of ultrasonication on chicken meat, particularly concerning amino acid composition and flavor enhancement, has not been sufficiently investigated. The objective of this research was to bridge the gap in the literature by exploring the impact of various ultrasonic treatments at varying power levels (300, 500, and 800 W) and durations (10 and 30 min) on the physicochemical characteristics, texture, and amino acid profile of chicken breast meat, with a focus on improving its palatability and flavor. The results indicated that ultrasonication reduced the pH and cooking loss, as well as hardness and chewiness while simultaneously increasing lightness and yellowness values of chicken breast meat. Moreover, ultrasonication enhanced the amounts of essential amino acids, including glutamic acid, alanine, and glycine as well as the free amino acid content, which gives meat its savory and umami flavor. Furthermore, the results demonstrated significant changes in the texture and structure, as demonstrated by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, and in chemical makeup of chicken breast meat, as indicated by the FTIR spectra. These modifications in the molecular and microstructural characteristics of meat, as induced by ultrasonication, may contribute to the enhancement of tenderness, juiciness, and overall palatability.",10.1016/j.ultsonch.2024.106824
"Chicken breasts were cured with different ingredients, including 4% (w/w) curing agent (GC), 5% (w/w) Aspergillus oryzae with rice (FR), A",Chicken,Aspergillus oryzae,Component-Whole,component-whole,The Effect of Fermented Grains (koji) on Physicochemical and Sensory Characteristics of Chicken Breasts.,"This study investigated the tenderizing and flavor-enhancing effects of koji, a fermented grain cultured with a single microorganism, on chicken breasts during curing. Chicken breasts were cured with different ingredients, including 4% (w/w) curing agent (GC), 5% (w/w) Aspergillus oryzae with rice (FR), A. oryzae with soybean (FS), and Bacillus subtilis with soybean (BS) for 4 h at 4 °C prior to cooking. After the superheated steam procedure, all samples were cooked in a convection oven, and their physicochemical properties were analyzed. Koji-treated samples exhibited significantly higher expressible moisture due to the degradation of the protein matrix (p < 0.05). Texture profile analysis showed that the tenderness of koji-treated samples was significantly higher than that of GC (p < 0.05). Furthermore, koji-treated samples were regarded as tenderer, and they were preferred over GC (p < 0.05) in the sensory evaluation. Principal attributes analysis revealed that the overall preference for koji-treated samples was highly correlated with umami, juiciness, and tenderness (p < 0.05). Overall, this study provides insights into applying koji as a potential curing treatment to improve the eating quality of chicken breasts. Koji can be used as a novel technology in the food industry to improve taste and tenderness simultaneously.",10.3390/foods12183463
"BACKGROUND
Previous studies have suggested that administration of epidural 3% 2-chloroprocaine (CP) before epidural Morphine results in decreased analgesic efficacy of epidural Morphine",before epidural Morphine,of epidural Morphine,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Postcesarean Analgesia With Epidural Morphine After Epidural 2-Chloroprocaine: A Randomized Noninferiority Trial.,"BACKGROUND
Previous studies have suggested that administration of epidural 3% 2-chloroprocaine (CP) before epidural morphine results in decreased analgesic efficacy of epidural morphine. We sought to determine whether these observations were a result of antagonism or a window period between the conclusion of surgical anesthesia for cesarean delivery and the peak onset time of epidural morphine, and whether a method to preserve the analgesic efficacy of epidural morphine exists.


METHODS
Term parturients scheduled for nonemergent, unscheduled cesarean delivery with preexisting labor epidural catheters were recruited for this exploratory, randomized, single-blinded, noninferiority trial. Subjects were randomized to initial dosing to a T4 dermatome surgical anesthetic level with either 3% CP or 2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine and sodium bicarbonate (LEB). Subsequent redosing for both groups was performed with LEB at regular intervals. Epidural morphine 3 mg was administered to both groups after delivery. Assessing the difference between the 2 groups in total opioid use for the first 24 hours after epidural morphine administration was the primary objective. The noninferiority margin of 10 oral milligram morphine equivalents was prespecified based on previous noninferiority studies. Secondary end points included time from epidural morphine administration to first rescue opioid request, numerical pain scores, nausea/vomiting, and pruritus.


RESULTS
Data were analyzed for 40 parturients, 20 in each group. The median 24-hour opioid consumption for the CP group was 0 (Q1 = 0 and Q3 = 15.6) oral milligram morphine equivalents compared to 15 (6.3-22.5) for the LEB group. The median difference was -7.5, with a 95% confidence interval -15 to 0. Noninferiority was concluded, as the confidence interval was less than the predetermined noninferiority margin of 10 oral milligram morphine equivalents. There was no treatment effect on time to first opioid request and no statistically significant differences in pain scores or nausea, vomiting, or pruritus at all time points (4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after epidural morphine administration).


CONCLUSION
While designed as an exploratory study, initial epidural dosing with 3% CP and beginning subsequent redosing with LEB within 30 minutes of the initial CP bolus provided noninferior postcesarean analgesia with epidural morphine compared to initial epidural dosing and redosing with LEB. Previous observations of decreased analgesic efficacy of epidural morphine after epidural CP were likely due to a window period that may be mitigated by redosing with lidocaine; however, larger studies are necessary to confirm these findings.",10.1213/ANE.0000000000006109
"Similarly, Histamine receptors in mast cells were significantly reduced after two different dosage of Bicalutamide treatment",Histamine,Bicalutamide,Component-Whole,cause-effect,"Bicalutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist, effectively alleviate allergic rhinitis via suppression of PI3K-PKB activity.","OBJECTIVES
To investigate the therapeutic effect of Bicalutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist on the onset and development of allergic rhinitis in an animal model.


METHODS
40 male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into five groups (eight mice per group). Aluminum hydroxide powder was used as an adjuvant, combined with Ovalbumin (OVA) to establish the mouse model of allergic rhinitis via ultrasonic nebulization of OVA to stimulate the nasal cavity. Mice in Bica#1 group were intraperitoneally injected with 0.02 mg Bicalutamide/0.5 ml of normal saline daily for 7 consecutive days; mice in Bica#2 group were administered 0.02 mg Bicalutamide/0.5 ml of normal saline via intraperitoneal injection for 5 consecutive days, and then the same amount of normal saline was injected intraperitoneally for 2 consecutive days. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was adopted to detect the serological levels of IgE, IL-4, and IL-6 production. Eosinophil infiltration was observed under microscope after hematoxylin and eosin staining of nasal mucosa. Quantitative PCR and Western blot were employed for determination of histamine receptors mRNA expression and PI3K/PKB associated protein levels, respectively.


RESULTS
Histological analysis shown that allergic lesion was induced after OVA sensitization. Intraperitoneal injection with 0.02 mg Bicalutamide daily for 7 consecutive days significantly reduced the allergic lesion; however, mice injected with the same amount of normal saline at the same time demonstrated no allergic rhinitis symptoms. In addition, there was a significant reduction in eosinophils number in Bicalutamide treated mice (n = 8) compared to the OVA group (n = 8) (OVA: 19.6 ± 5.3 vs. Bica#1: 7.7 ± 0.8 vs. Bica#2: 9.4 ± 1.2, both p < 0.01). Furthermore, ELISA results revealed that the serological levels of IgE (OVA: 17.3 ± 1.7 µg/ml vs. Bica#1: 9.2 ± 0.6 vs. Bica#2: 10.4 ± 2.3, both p < 0.05), IL-4 (OVA: 164.3 ± 5.1 pg/ml vs. Bica#1: 110.2 ± 3.1 vs. Bica#2: 115.3 ± 4.1, both p < 0.05) and IL-6 (OVA: 167.3 ± 3.7 pg/ml vs. Bica#1: 117.5 ± 6.5 vs. Bica#2: 114.8 ± 2.4, both p < 0.05) were significantly decreased after two different dosage of Bicalutamide treatment. Similarly, histamine receptors in mast cells were significantly reduced after two different dosage of Bicalutamide treatment. More importantly, p-PKB protein was notably reduced after two different dosage of Bicalutamide treatment compared to the OVA group, mTOR protein levels were also down regulated after two different dosage of Bicalutamide treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
Our data demonstrated that androgen receptor antagonist Bicalutamide can significantly alleviate allergic rhinitis lesion in the animal model. PI3K/PKB activity in mast cells was suppressed after Bicalutamide injection. Our results provide important implication in allergic rhinitis prevention and treatment.",10.1007/s00405-022-07538-w
"The illegal addition of Metronidazole during cosmetics production can result in residual 2-methylimidazole (2-MEI), which, along with 4-Methylimidazole (4-MEI), is a class 2B carcinogen",Metronidazole,4-Methylimidazole,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,[Determination of three methylimidazole compounds in cosmetics by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry].,"Methylimidazole compounds are byproducts formed during the caramel-coloring process and are used in various cosmetics. In addition metronidazole is an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory drug commonly used in modern medicine and is used in cosmetics to treat acne in the short-term. The illegal addition of metronidazole during cosmetics production can result in residual 2-methylimidazole (2-MEI), which, along with 4-methylimidazole (4-MEI), is a class 2B carcinogen. Therefore, establishing efficient, accurate, and sensitive analytical techniques for analyzing methylimidazole compounds in cosmetics is an urgent objective. In this study, a high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method for simultaneously determining 1-methylimidazole (1-MEI), 2-MEI, and 4-MEI in cosmetics was developed. Cosmetics samples were extracted via ultrasonication in acetonitrile and purified using a mixed cation-exchange (MCX) solid-phase extraction (SPE) column, with subsequent drying under a stream of nitrogen and redissolution in acetonitrile. The resulting solution was then filtered through a 0.22 μm organic filter membrane for further testing. The analytes were separated using an XBridge® shield RP18 chromatographic column (150 mm×4.6 mm, 3.5 μm) and isocratically eluted with 20 mmol/L ammonium formate solution (containing 0.1% formic acid)-acetonitrile (98∶2, v/v). The target compounds were ionized by electrospray ionization (ESI) source, analyzed in multi-reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, and quantified using the external standard method, with the peak area of the quantitative ion and the mass concentration of the compound taken as the longitudinal and transverse coordinates, respectively. Matrix-matching working curves were also constructed. 1-MEI exhibited good linear relationships in the range of 5-200 μg/L, with correlation coefficients (r2)≥0.9994, while 2-MEI and 4-MEI showed good linearities in the range of 2-100 μg/L with r2≥0.9984. The three methylimidazole compounds exhibited limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs) of 10-30 μg/kg and 25-100 μg/kg, respectively. Under three spiked levels (LOQ, 2LOQ, 10LOQ), the recoveries of three methylimidazole compounds were 80.9%-107.9%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs, n=6) of 1.2%-12.8%. The practicability of the method was examined using 48 cosmetic samples; 4-MEI was detected in nine samples at contents of 26-1000 μg/kg, while two samples contained 240 and 267 μg/kg of 2-MEI, respectively. 1-MEI was not detected in any of the 48 samples tested. The developed method is simple, fast, and highly sensitive, and provides methodological support for assessing risks and monitoring the three methylimidazole compounds in cosmetics through screening.",10.3724/SP.J.1123.2023.11011

However, due to its poor water solubility, commercially available formulations contain alcohol and propylene glycol in a concentration that causes skin reactions such as irritation and dryness. Therefore, nanotechnology-based formulations can offer an alternative that might increase penetration and deposition of the drug in the skin while minimizing its adverse reactions. Minoxidil cubosomes (MXD-CUB) were prepared by melt dispersion emulsification technique according to full 23 factorial design. Three independent variables, namely, the dispersed phase concentration, glyceryl monooleate: Poloxamer 407 ratio and Tween 80 concentration were tested. Particle size, polydispersity index and the zeta potential were the dependent variables. The optimized formula was investigated by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry and in vitro release test. In vivo study included Draize test, histopathological examination, hair regrowth efficacy and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Particle size, zeta potential and polydispersity index of the optimal MXD-CUB were measured to be 131.10 ± 1.41 nm, -23.5 ± 0.42 mV and 0.185 ± 0.0, respectively, and its entrapment efficiency was 80.4 ± 4.04 %. Draize test and histopathological testing proved safety and tolerability of MXD-CUB. In vivo hair regrowth study revealed greater hair growth boosting effect of the prepared cubosomes compared to minoxidil solution. CLSM proved superior penetration and retention of rhodamine B-loaded cubosomes in the skin compared to rhodamine B solution. Therefore, MXD-CUB can be a safe and effective dosage form for minoxidil that overcome the drawbacks of the commercial formulations.",10.1016/j.ijpharm.2023.122665
Two low-dose groups of oral formulations (ritlecitinib 10mg and Ivarmacitinib 2mg) and two topical formulations (Delgocitinib ointment and ruxolitinib cream) appeared to be relatively ineffective against moderate-to-severe AA,Ivarmacitinib,Delgocitinib,Component-Whole,component-whole,Comparative efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of moderate-to-severe alopecia areata: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"We performed a Bayesian network meta-analysis to indirectly compare the relative efficacy and safety of the latest JAK inhibitors for moderate-to-severe alopecia areata (AA). 13 trials totaling 3,613 patients were included. Two low-dose groups of oral formulations (ritlecitinib 10mg and ivarmacitinib 2mg) and two topical formulations (delgocitinib ointment and ruxolitinib cream) appeared to be relatively ineffective against moderate-to-severe AA. Ranking analysis suggested that brepocitinib 30mg has the best relative effect in reducing the SALT score (sucra = 0.9831), and demonstrated comparable efficacy to deuruxolitinib 12mg (sucra = 0.9245), followed by deuruxolitinib 8mg (sucra = 0.7736). Regarding the SALT50 response, brepocitinib 30mg ranked highest (sucra = 0.9567), followed by ritlecitinib 50mg (sucra = 0.8689) and deuruxolitinib 12mg (sucra = 0.7690). For achieving the SALT75 response, deuruxolitinib 12mg had the highest probability (sucra = 0.9761), followed by deuruxolitinib 8mg (sucra = 0.8678) and brepocitinib 30mg (sucra = 0.8448). Deuruxolitinib 12mg might be the most effective therapy for patients with severe AA (sucra = 0.9395), followed by ritlecitinib 50mg (sucra = 0.8753) and deuruxolitinib 8mg (sucra = 0.8070). Deuruxolitinib 12mg/8mg demonstrated notable efficacy for moderate-to-severe AA, and is expected to be a new treatment option for AA. It was worth noting that deuruxolitinib exhibit a greater likelihood of causing adverse events in comparison to other JAK inhibitors. Ritlecitinib 50mg seemed to exhibit fewer adverse effects in the high-dose groups of oral JAK inhibitors and might be an optimal choice to balance safety and efficacy. The majority of JAK inhibitors exhibited acceptable short-term safety profiles.

"However, increasing Mannose-6-phosphate levels resulted in increased cell uptake in vitro and increased glycogen clearance and transcriptional correction in Pompe mice, further underscoring the crucial role of cation-independent Mannose-6-phosphate receptor-mediated lysosomal targeting for ERTs.","However, increasing Mannose",of cation-independent Mannose,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Increasing Enzyme Mannose-6-Phosphate Levels but Not Miglustat Coadministration Enhances the Efficacy of Enzyme Replacement Therapy in Pompe Mice.,"Pompe disease is a rare glycogen storage disorder caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme acid α-glucosidase, which leads to muscle weakness, cardiac and respiratory failure, and early mortality. Alglucosidase alfa, a recombinant human acid α-glucosidase, was the first approved treatment of Pompe disease, but its uptake into skeletal muscle via the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptor (CIMPR) is limited. Avalglucosidase alfa has received marketing authorization in several countries for infantile-onset and/or late-onset Pompe disease. This recently approved enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) was glycoengineered to maximize CIMPR binding through high-affinity interactions with ∼7 bis-M6P moieties. Recently, small molecules like the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor miglustat were reported to increase the stability of recombinant human acid α-glucosidase, and it was suggested that an increased serum half-life would result in better glycogen clearance. Here, the effects of miglustat on alglucosidase alfa and avalglucosidase alfa stability, activity, and efficacy in Pompe mice were evaluated. Although miglustat increased the stability of both enzymes in fluorescent protein thermal shift assays and when incubated in neutral pH buffer over time, it reduced their enzymatic activity by ∼50%. Improvement in tissue glycogen clearance and transcriptional dysregulation in Pompe mice correlated with M6P levels but not with miglustat coadministration. These results further substantiate the crucial role of CIMPR binding in lysosomal targeting of ERTs. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This work describes important new insights into the treatment of Pompe disease using currently approved enzyme replacement therapies (ERTs) coadministered with miglustat. Although miglustat increased the stability of ERTs in vitro, there was no positive impact to glycogen clearance and transcriptional correction in Pompe mice. However, increasing mannose-6-phosphate levels resulted in increased cell uptake in vitro and increased glycogen clearance and transcriptional correction in Pompe mice, further underscoring the crucial role of cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor-mediated lysosomal targeting for ERTs.",10.1124/jpet.123.001593

We wanted to share our experiences in the management of these high-risk patients, from diagnostic tests in allergological evaluation to the vaccination process.


Materials and Methods
Our retrospective cross-sectional study included patients who had previously developed an allergic reaction to COVID-19 vaccines or drugs and therefore were referred to our allergy and immunology clinic. Prick and intradermal tests were performed on all patients with methylprednisolone acetate (Depo-Medrol®, Pfizer) 40 mg/mL containing polyethylene Glycol (PEG) and triamcinolone acetonide (Kenacort®, Deva) 40 mg/mL containing polysorbate 80. While vaccination with desensitization was recommended for all patients with positive skin tests, split-dose vaccination was recommended for patients with negative skin tests. After explaining the risks and benefits, the choice of the vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech or Sinovac/ CoronoVac) was left to the patients' discretion.


Result
A total of 41 patients, 10 males, and 31 females, with a mean age of 42.37 ± 14.177 years were included. Eighteen patients with a history of allergy after COVID-19 vaccines were analyzed according to the type of reaction and type of vaccine administered (Pfizer/BioNTech/Coronovac; Anaphylaxis: 4/1, Urticaria: 11/2). Moreover, there was a history of drug allergy in 23 patients who had not been vaccinated before. Skin tests with PEG were positive in a total of seven patients while skin tests with polysorbate 80 were negative in all patients. No allergic reaction developed in seven patients who underwent desensitization and in 34 patients who received a split dose.


Conclusions
Considering the potentially life-saving benefits of vaccination in a global pandemic environment, it is a safe and effective method to administer vaccines to at-risk patients using desensitization or split dosing techniques, based on their sensitivity status determined through a PEG skin test.

To this end, 6 groups were formed: control, PTX, sham, 1 mg/PTL, 2 mg/kg PTL, and 4 mg/kg PTL. Pain formation was tested by Randall-Selitto analgesiometry and locomotor activity behavioral analysis. Then, PTL treatment was performed for 14 days. After the last dose of PTL was taken, Hcn2, Trpa1, Scn9a, and Kcns1 gene expressions were measured in rat brain (cerebral cortex/CTX) tissues. In addition, changes in the levels of SCN9A and KCNS1 proteins were determined by immunohistochemical analysis. Histopathological hematoxylin-eosin staining was also performed to investigate the effect of PTL in treating tissue damage on neuropathic pain caused by PTX treatment. When the obtained data were analyzed, pain threshold and locomotor activity decreased in PTX and sham groups and increased with PTL treatment. In addition, it was observed that the expression of the Hcn2, Trpa1, and Scn9a genes decreased while the Kcns1 gene expression increased. When protein levels were examined, it was determined that SCN9A protein expression decreased and the KCNS1 protein level increased. It was determined that PTL treatment also improved PTX-induced tissue damage. The results of this study demonstrate that non-opioid PTL is an effective therapeutic agent in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain, especially when used at a dose of 4 mg/kg acting on sodium and potassium channels.",10.1007/s00210-023-02568-5

Wheat stem sawfly (WSS), Cephus cinctus Norton, is a major pest of common bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and other cultivated cereals in North America. Planting of cultivars with solid stems has been the primary management strategy to prevent yield loss due to WSS infestation, however expression of this phenotype can vary depending on environmental conditions and solid stems hinder biological control of WSS via braconid parasitoids Bracon cephi (Gahan) and Bracon lissogaster Muesebeck. In the hollow stems of oat (Avena sativa L.), WSS larvae experience 100% mortality before they reach late instars, but the mechanisms for this observed resistance have not been characterized.


Objective
The objective of this study was to explore additional sources of resistance outside of the historic solid stem phenotype.


Methods
Here, we use an untargeted metabolomics approach to examine the response of the metabolome of two cultivars of oat and four cultivars of spring wheat to infestation by WSS. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), differentially expressed metabolites were identified between oat and wheat which were associated with the phenylpropanoid pathway, phospholipid biosynthesis and signaling, the salicylic acid signaling pathway, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) degradation, and biosynthesis of 1,4-benzoxazin-3-ones (Bxs). Several phospho- and galacto- lipids were found in higher abundance in oat, and with the exception of early stem solidness cultivar Conan, both species experienced a decrease in abundance once infested. In all wheat cultivars except Conan, an increase in abundance was observed for Bxs HMDBOA-glc and DIBOA-β-D-glucoside after infestation, indicating that this pathway is involved in wheat response to infestation in both solid and hollow stemmed cultivars. Differences between species in compounds involved in IAA biosynthesis, degradation and inactivation suggest that wheat may respond to infestation by inactivating IAA or altering the IAA pool in stem tissue.


Conclusion
We propose that the species differences found here likely affect the survival of WSS larvae and may also be associated with differences in stem architecture at the molecular level. Our findings suggest pathways to focus on for future studies in elucidating plant response to WSS infestation.",10.3389/fpls.2024.1327390

The docking score of vasicine (-5.27) is nearly identical to the standard Eltrombopag (-6.08), and both ligands bind with one Hydrogen bond",Eltrombopag,Hydrogen,Component-Whole,component-whole,Molecular Docking Analysis of Adhatoda vasica with Thromboxane A2 Receptor (TXA2R) (6IIU) and Antiviral Molecules for Possible Dengue Complications.,"OBJECTIVE
The present study is an in silico model of platelet amplification potential of Adhatoda vasica, which can be used to treat thrombocytopenia in dengue complications.


METHODS
Docking studies have proved to be an essential tool that facilitates the structural diversity of natural products to be harnessed in an organized manner. In the present study, vasicine containing natural anti-dengue potential was subjected to docking studies using Schrodinger glides software (ver.11.1). The docking study was carried out to find out the potential molecular targets for selected protein. The docking was carried out on different ligands, like vasicine, ramatroban, chloroquine, celgosivir, and standard eltrombopag downloaded from PubChem and retrieved to glide software and ligands prepared using lig prep wizard. Docking was performed using the ligand docking wizard of Glide-maestro 2018.


RESULTS
The docking score of vasicine (-5.27) is nearly identical to the standard eltrombopag (-6.08), and both ligands bind with one hydrogen bond. The validation score of ramatroban is -12.39, binding with five hydrogen bonds, Celgosivir exhibited a docking score of -7.3 with three hydrogen bonds, and chloroquine displayed no hydrogen bond but had a docking score of -4.6.


CONCLUSION
Vasicine was found to be the most suitable target of platelet amplification potential from Adhatoda vasica. However, the molecular docking results are preliminary, and it has been indicated that vasicine could be one of the potential ligands to treat the thrombocytopenia of dengue; experimental evaluation will be carried out in the near future.",10.2174/1871526522666220718101544

Myosin plays a crucial role in cellular processes, while its dysfunction can lead to organismal malfunction. Phenamacril (PHA), a highly species-specific and non-competitive inhibitor of myosin I (FgMyoI) from Fusarium graminearum, has been identified as an effective fungicide for controlling plant diseases caused by partial Fusarium pathogens, such as wheat scab and rice bakanae. However, the molecular basis of its action is still unclear.


RESULTS
This study used multiple computational approaches first to elucidate the allosteric inhibition mechanism of FgMyoI by PHA at the atomistic level. The results indicated the increase of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding affinity upon PHA binding, which might impede the release of hydrolysis products. Furthermore, simulations revealed a broadened outer cleft and a significantly more flexible interface for actin binding, accompanied by a decrease in signaling transduction from the catalytic center to the actin-binding interface. These various effects might work together to disrupt the actomyosin cycle and hinder the ability of motor to generate force. Our experimental results further confirmed that PHA reduces the enzymatic activity of myosin and its binding with actin.


CONCLUSION
Therefore, our findings demonstrated that PHA might suppress the function of myosin through a synergistic mechanism, providing new insights into myosin allostery and offering new avenues for drug/fungicide discovery targeting myosin. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",10.1002/ps.7699

This event triggered considerable interest in the study of heavy metals and their presence in the environment (air, water, soil, and food). It is probable that their accumulation in the body could lead to a high risk of the onset of numerous pathologies, including brain tumors, in humans. Heavy metals are capable of generating reactive oxygen, which plays a key role in various pathological mechanisms. Alteration of the homeostasis of heavy metals could cause the overproduction of reactive oxygen species and induce DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and the alteration of proteins. A large number of studies have shown that iron, cadmium, lead, nickel, chromium, and mercury levels were significantly elevated in patients affected by gliomas.

Dietary approaches are recommended for the management of chronic constipation. Until now, there has been no systematic review and meta-analysis on foods, drinks and diets in constipation.


AIMS
To investigate the effect of foods, drinks and diets on response to treatment, stool output, gut transit time, symptoms, quality of life, adverse events and compliance in adults with chronic constipation via a systematic review and meta-analysis.


METHODS
Studies were identified using electronic databases (12th July 2023). Intervention trials (randomised controlled trials [RCTs], non-randomised, uncontrolled) were included. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane 2.0 (RCTs) or JBI Critical Appraisal (uncontrolled trials). Data from RCTs only were synthesised using risk ratios (RRs), mean differences (MDs), standardised mean differences (95% CI) using random-effects.


RESULTS
We included 23 studies (17 RCTs, 6 uncontrolled; 1714 participants): kiwifruit (n = 7), high-mineral water (n = 4), prunes (n = 2), rye bread (n = 2), mango, fig, cereal, oat bran, yoghurt, water supplementation, prune juice, high-fibre diet, no-fibre diet (n = 1). Fruits resulted in higher stool frequency than psyllium (MD: +0.36 bowel movements [BM]/week, [0.25-0.48], n = 232), kiwifruits in particular (MD: +0.36 BM/week, [0.24-0.48], n = 192); there was no difference for prunes compared with psyllium. Rye bread resulted in higher stool frequency than white bread (MD: +0.43 BM/week, [0.03-0.83], n = 48). High-mineral water resulted in higher response to treatment than low-mineral water (RR: 1.47, [1.20-1.81], n = 539).


CONCLUSIONS
Fruits and rye bread may improve certain constipation-related outcomes. There is a scarcity of evidence on foods, drinks and diets in constipation and further RCTs are needed.",10.1111/apt.17782

Chickens and ducks are the major hosts and play essential roles in the transmission and evolution of H9N2 AIV. Vaccines are considered an effective strategy for fighting H9N2 infection. However, due to the differences in immune responses to infection, vaccines against H9N2 AIV suitable for use in both chickens and ducks have not been well studied. This study developed an inactivated H9N2 vaccine based on a duck-origin H9N2 AIV and assessed its effectiveness in the laboratory. The results showed that the inactivated H9N2 vaccine elicited significant haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies in both chickens and ducks. Virus challenge experiments revealed that immunization with this vaccine significantly blocked virus shedding after infection by both homogenous and heterologous H9N2 viruses. The vaccine was efficacious in chicken and duck flocks under normal field conditions. We also found that egg-yolk antibodies were produced by laying birds immunized with the inactivated vaccine, and high levels of maternal antibodies were detected in the serum of the offspring. Taken together, our study showed that this inactivated H9N2 vaccine could be extremely favourable for the prevention of H9N2 in both chickens and ducks.",10.3390/vaccines11030596

As new infectious diseases (ID) emerge and others continue to mutate, there remains an imminent threat, especially for vulnerable individuals. Yet no generalizable framework exists to identify the at-risk group prior to infection. Metabolomics has the advantage of capturing the existing physiologic state, unobserved via current clinical measures. Furthermore, metabolomics profiling during acute disease can be influenced by confounding factors such as indications, medical treatments, and lifestyles.


METHODS
We employed metabolomic profiling to cluster infection-free individuals and assessed their relationship with COVID severity and influenza incidence/recurrence.


FINDINGS
We identified a metabolomic susceptibility endotype that was strongly associated with both severe COVID (ORICUadmission = 6.7, p-value = 1.2 × 10-08, ORmortality = 4.7, p-value = 1.6 × 10-04) and influenza (ORincidence = 2.9; p-values = 2.2 × 10-4, βrecurrence = 1.03; p-value = 5.1 × 10-3). We observed similar severity associations when recapitulating this susceptibility endotype using metabolomics from individuals during and after acute COVID infection. We demonstrate the value of using metabolomic endotyping to identify a metabolically susceptible group for two-and potentially more-IDs that are driven by increases in specific amino acids, including microbial-related metabolites such as tryptophan, bile acids, histidine, polyamine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine metabolism, as well as carbohydrates involved in glycolysis.


INTERPRETATIONS
These metabolites may be identified prior to infection to enable protective measures for these individuals.

We included studies wherein the metabolomic biomarkers for racemic ketamine or esketamine were investigated in TRD or HCs. Our main outcomes were to examine changes in metabolites among patients treated with ketamine/esketamine and explore the association with response to ketamine/esketamine.


RESULTS
A total of 1859 abstracts were screened of which 11 were included for full-text review. Of these, a total of five articles were included (N = 147), including three RCTs (n = 129) and two open-label trials (n = 18). All studies used racemic ketamine; one study additionally used esketamine. The included studies evaluated patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression (n = 22), unipolar depression (n = 91), and HCs (n = 34). The included studies reported alteration in several metabolites including acylcarnitines, lipids, kynurenine (KYN), and arginine with ketamine in TRD. Studies suggest the involvement of energy metabolism, KYN, and arginine pathways. In HCs, acetylcarnitine decreased post-infusion, whereas inconsistent findings were observed after the ketamine infusion in TRD patients.


CONCLUSIONS
This systematic review provides preliminary evidence that ketamine may cause changes in several important pathways involved in energy metabolism and inflammation. Larger and more rigorous studies are needed.",10.1111/bdi.13412
"CONCLUSION
The analgesic properties of α-Mangostin might be mediated by the multi-target modulation of ion channels, including TREK/TRAAK activation, TRPV1 inhibition, and reduction of the Tetrodotoxin-sensitive NaV current",Mangostin,Tetrodotoxin,Component-Whole,cause-effect,Multi-target modulation of ion channels underlying the analgesic effects of α-mangostin in dorsal root ganglion neurons.,"BACKGROUND
α-Mangostin is a xanthone isolated from the pericarps of mangosteen fruit with, and has analgesic properties. Although the effects suggest an interaction of α-mangostin with ion channels in the nociceptive neurons, electrophysiological investigation of the underlying mechanism has not been performed.


HYPOTHESIS
We hypothesized that α-Mangostin exerts its analgesic effects by modulating the activity of various ion channels in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons.


METHODS
We performed a whole-cell patch clamp study using mouse DRG neurons, HEK293T cells overexpressing targeted ion channels, and ND7/23 cells. Molecular docking (MD) and in silico absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) analyses were conducted to obtain further insights into the binding sites and pharmacokinetics, respectively.


RESULTS
Application of α-mangostin (1-3 µM) hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential (RMP) of small-sized DRG neurons by increasing background K+ conductance and thereby inhibited action potential generation. At micromolar levels, α-mangostin activates TREK-1, TREK-2, or TRAAK, members of the two-pore domain K+ channel (K2P) family known to be involved in RMP formation in DRG neurons. Furthermore, capsaicin-induced TRPV1 currents were potently inhibited by α-mangostin (0.43 ± 0.27 µM), and partly suppressed tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated Na+ channel (NaV) currents. MD simulation revealed that multiple oxygen atoms in α-mangostin may form stable hydrogen bonds with TREKs, TRAAK, TRPV1, and NaV channels. In silico ADME tests suggested that α-mangostin may satisfy the drug-likeness properties without penetrating the blood-brain barrier.


CONCLUSION
The analgesic properties of α-mangostin might be mediated by the multi-target modulation of ion channels, including TREK/TRAAK activation, TRPV1 inhibition, and reduction of the tetrodotoxin-sensitive NaV current. The findings suggest that the phytochemical can be a multi-ion channel-targeting drug and an alternative drug for effective pain management.",10.1016/j.phymed.2023.154791

It is not yet known whether remimazolam clinically attenuates or worsens pain. The present study investigated the effect of intraoperative remimazolam on opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) in patients undergoing general anesthesia. Materials and Methods: The patients were randomized into three groups: group RHR (6 mg/kg/h initial dose followed by 1 mg/kg/h remimazolam and 0.3 μg /kg/min remifentanil), group DHR (desflurane and 0.3 μg /kg/min remifentanil) or group DLR (desflurane and 0.05 µg/kg /min remifentanil). The primary outcome was a mechanical hyperalgesia threshold, while secondary outcomes included an area of hyperalgesia and clinically relevant pain outcomes. Results: Group RHR had a higher mechanical hyperalgesia threshold, a smaller hyperalgesia postoperative area at 24 h, a longer time to first rescue analgesia (p = 0.04), lower cumulative PCA volume containing morphine postoperatively consumed for 24 h (p < 0.01), and lower pain intensity for 12 h than group DHR (p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in OIH between groups RHR and DLR. Conclusions: Group RHR, which received remimazolam, attenuated OIH, including mechanically evoked pain and some clinically relevant pain outcomes caused by a high dose of remifentanil. Further research is essential to determine how clinically meaningful and important the small differences observed between the two groups are.",10.3390/medicina60010123
Morphine and Codeine are the two principal opiates found in the Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) and are therapeutically used for pain management,Codeine,Opium,Component-Whole,component-whole,"Applicability of LC-QToF and Microscopical Tools in Combating the Sophisticated, Economically Motivated Adulteration of Poppy Seeds.","Morphine and codeine are the two principal opiates found in the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) and are therapeutically used for pain management. Poppy seeds with low opiates are primarily used for culinary purposes due to their nutritional and sensory attributes. Intentional adulteration of poppy seeds is common, often combined with immature, less expensive, exhausted, or substituted with morphologically similar seeds, viz., amaranth, quinoa, and sesame. For a safer food supply chain, preventive measures must be implemented to mitigate contamination or adulteration. Moreover, the simultaneous analysis of P. somniferum and its adulterants is largely unknown. Pre- and post-processing further complicate the alkaloid content and may pose a significant health hazard. To address these issues, two independent methods were investigated with eight botanically verified and fifteen commercial samples. Microscopical features were established for the authenticity of raw poppy seeds. Morphine, codeine, and thebaine quantities ranged from 0.8-223, 0.2-386, and 0.1-176 mg/kg, respectively, using LC-QToF. In most cases, conventional opiates have a higher content than papaverine and noscapine. The analytical methodology provided a chemical profile of 47 compounds that can be effectively applied to distinguish poppy seeds from their adulterants and may serve as an effective tool to combat ongoing adulteration.",10.3390/foods12071510
The optical band gaps obtained from the Tauc plot indicated that the incorporation of Iron has led to a decreased band gap of Zinc ferrite (2.89 eV) than pure ZnO (3.14 eV),Iron,Zinc,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Development of zinc ferrite nanoparticles with enhanced photocatalytic performance for remediation of environmentally toxic pharmaceutical waste diclofenac sodium from wastewater.,"Diclofenac sodium is an anti-inflammatory drug commonly used to cure pain in various treatments. The remarkable potential of this pain-killer leads to its excessive use and, therefore, a persistent water contaminant. Its presence in aqueous bodies is hazardous for both humans and the environment because it causes the growth of harmful drug-resistant bacteria in water. Herein, we present a comparative study of the ZnO and ZnFe2O4 as photocatalysts for the degradation of diclofenac sodium, along with their structural and morphological studies. A simple co-precipitation method was used for the synthesis of ZnO and ZnFe2O4 and characterized by various analytical techniques. For instance, the UV-Vis study revealed the absorption maxima of ZnO at 320 nm, which was shifted to a longer wavelength region at 365 nm for zinc ferrite. The optical band gaps obtained from the Tauc plot indicated that the incorporation of iron has led to a decreased band gap of zinc ferrite (2.89 eV) than pure ZnO (3.14 eV). The metal-oxygen linkages shown by FTIR indicated the formation of desired ZnO and ZnFe2O4, which was further confirmed by XRD. It elucidated the typical hexagonal structure for ZnO and spinel cubic structure for ZnFe2O4 with an average crystallite of 31 nm and 44 nm for ZnO and ZnFe2O4, respectively. The micrographs obtained by SEM showed rough spherical particles of ZnO, whereas for ZnFe2O4 flower-like clustered particles were observed. The photocatalytic investigation against diclofenac sodium revealed the higher degradation efficiency of ZnFe2O4 (61.4%) in only 120 min, whereas ZnO degraded only 48.9% of the drug. Moreover, zinc ferrite has shown good recyclability and was stable up to five runs of photodegradation with a small loss (3.9%) of photocatalytic activity. The comparison of two catalysts has suggested the promising role of zinc ferrite in wastewater remediation to eliminate hazardous pharmaceuticals.",10.1016/j.envres.2022.114500

"BACKGROUND
AngII (Angiotensin II)-dependent hypertension causes comparable elevations of blood pressure (BP), Aldosterone levels, and renal ENaC (epithelial Na+ channel) activity in male and female rodents",Angiotensin II,Aldosterone,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Aldosterone Antagonism Is More Effective at Reducing Blood Pressure and Excessive Renal ENaC Activity in AngII-Infused Female Rats Than in Males.,"BACKGROUND
AngII (angiotensin II)-dependent hypertension causes comparable elevations of blood pressure (BP), aldosterone levels, and renal ENaC (epithelial Na+ channel) activity in male and female rodents. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonism has a limited antihypertensive effect associated with insufficient suppression of renal ENaC in male rodents with AngII-hypertension. While MR blockade effectively reduces BP in female mice with salt-sensitive and leptin-induced hypertension, MR antagonism has not been studied in female rodents with AngII-hypertension. We hypothesize that overstimulation of renal MR signaling drives redundant ENaC-mediated Na+ reabsorption and BP increase in female rats with AngII-hypertension.


METHODS
We employ a combination of physiological, pharmacological, biochemical, and biophysical approaches to compare the effect of MR inhibitors on BP and ENaC activity in AngII-infused male and female Sprague Dawley rats.


RESULTS
MR blockade markedly attenuates AngII-hypertension in female rats but has only a marginal effect in males. Spironolactone increases urinary sodium excretion and urinary sodium-to-potassium ratio in AngII-infused female, but not male, rats. The expression of renal MR and HSD11β2 (11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2) that determines the availability of MR to aldosterone is significantly higher in AngII-infused female rats than in males. ENaC activity is ≈2× lower in spironolactone-treated AngII-infused female rats than in males. Reduced ENaC activity in AngII-infused female rats on spironolactone correlates with increased interaction with ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 (neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4-2), targeting ENaC for degradation.


CONCLUSIONS
MR-ENaC axis is the primary determinant of excessive renal sodium reabsorption and an attractive antihypertensive target in female rats with AngII-hypertension, but not in males.",10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.21287

This study determined the mutagenic and genotoxic potential of petroleum refinery wastewater and a receiving river using the Ames fluctuation test on Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and TA98, SOS chromotest on Escherichia coli PQ37, and piscine peripheral micronucleus (MN) assay. Analyses of the physicochemical parameters, heavy metal, and organic contents of the samples were also performed. Ames test result showed that the two tested samples were mutagenic with TA100 strain as the more responsive strain for both the refinery wastewater and the river sample in terms of the calculated mutagenic index. A similar result was obtained in the SOS chromotest; however, the E. coli PQ37 system recorded a slightly higher sensitivity for detecting genotoxins than the Salmonella assay in the two samples. MN data showed induction of a concentration-dependent significant (p < 0.05) increase in the frequency of MN by both samples when compared with the negative control.

Opioids are commonly used for the management of cancer-associated pain and chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea. The chemotherapeutic irinotecan (CPT-11) causes severe gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity due to deconjugation of inactive metabolite SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G) by bacterial β-glucuronidases to the active 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38). Opioids are known to cause gut microbial dysbiosis, this study evaluated whether CPT-11 anti-tumour efficacy and GI toxicity are exacerbated by opioid co-administration.


EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
Eight-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were co-administration with CPT-11 ± opioid. 16S rRNA sequencing was used for gut microbiome analysis. LC-MS analyses of plasma and intestinal extracts were performed to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of CPT-11. Histological analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to determine the severity of intestinal tissue damage. Human liver microsome In vitro assay was performed to confirm the effects of opioids on CPT-11 metabolism.


KEY RESULTS
Gut microbiome analysis showed that morphine treatment induced enrichment of β-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the intestines of CPT-11-treated mice, resulting in SN-38 accumulation and exacerbation of GI toxicity in the small intestine. Oral administration of both antibiotics and glucuronidase inhibitor protected mice against GI toxicity induced with CPT-11 and morphine co-administration, implicating a microbiome-dependent mechanism. Additionally, morphine and loperamide decreased the plasma concentration of SN-38 and compromised CPT-11 anti-tumour efficacy, this seemed to be microbiome independent.


CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS
Gut microbiota play a significant role in opioid and chemotherapeutic agent drug-drug interactions. Inhibition of gut microbial glucuronidase may also prevent adverse GI effects of CPT-11 in patients on opioids.",10.1111/bph.16020

70 patients who had undergone Phenol technique surgery for ingrown toenail were divided into two groups - control (n = 35) who received post-operative cures following the standard protocol with Povidone iodine gel, and experimental (n = 35) who received cures with HA in the first 3 visits",Phenol,Povidone,Component-Whole,cause-effect,Effectiveness of hyaluronic acid in post-surgical cures following partial matricectomies with the phenol/alcohol technique: A randomized clinical trial.,"BACKGROUND
Post-operative cures with hyaluronic acid (HA) could potentially shorten the period recovery involved in the phenol technique for ingrown toenail. The aim of this study was therefore to compare a standard healing protocol with the experimental one based on hyaluronic acid cream.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
70 patients who had undergone phenol technique surgery for ingrown toenail were divided into two groups - control (n = 35) who received post-operative cures following the standard protocol with povidone iodine gel, and experimental (n = 35) who received cures with HA in the first 3 visits.

RESULTS
Patients in the control group recovered from the intervention in a total of 26.17 ± 7.75 days, while those in the HA group recovered in a significantly shorter time - 22.42 ± 2.41 days (p = 0.007, effect size 0.653). However, there were no between-group statistical differences in bleeding or perceived pain over the course of the post-surgery visits.

The primary metabolism of plants, which is mediated by nitrogen, is closely related to the defense response to insect herbivores.


Methods
An experimental system was established to examine how nitrogen mediated tomato resistance to an insect herbivore, the oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis). All tomatoes were randomly assigned to the suitable nitrogen (control, CK) treatment, nitrogen excess (NE) treatment and nitrogen deficiency (ND) treatment.


Results
We found that nitrogen excess significantly increased the aboveground biomass of tomato and increased the pupal biomass of B. dorsalis. Metabolome analysis showed that nitrogen excess promoted the biosynthesis of amino acids in healthy fruits, including γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), arginine and asparagine. GABA was not a differential metabolite induced by injury by B. dorsalis under nitrogen excess, but it was significantly induced in infested fruits at appropriate nitrogen levels. GABA supplementation not only increased the aboveground biomass of plants but also improved the defensive response of tomato.


Discussion
The biosynthesis of GABA in tomato is a resistance response to feeding by B. dorsalis in appropriate nitrogen, whereas nitrogen excess facilitates the pupal weight of B. dorsalis by inhibiting synthesis of the GABA pathway. This study concluded that excess nitrogen inhibits tomato defenses in plant-insect interactions by inhibiting GABA synthesis, answering some unresolved questions about the nitrogen-dependent GABA resistance pathway to herbivores.",10.3389/fpls.2023.1252455

"Ammonia, one of the most polluted gases in Poultry houses, has always been an urgent problem to solve",Ammonia,Poultry,Component-Whole,neither,Effects of Atmospheric Ammonia on Skeletal Muscle Growth in Broilers.,"Ammonia, one of the most polluted gases in poultry houses, has always been an urgent problem to solve. Exposure to ammonia can threaten the respiratory tract, induce inflammation, and decrease growth performance. To date, there are few studies investigating the effects of ammonia on skeletal muscle growth. In this experiment, a total of 144 broilers were randomly divided into two groups, and 0 ppm and 35 ppm atmospheric ammonia were administered in the chambers. The trial lasted for 21 days. The breast muscle, thigh muscle, dressed weight, and serum biochemical indexes were measured. The skeletal muscle fibre morphology was observed using light microscopy, and the expressions of genes associated with skeletal muscle development and myosin heavy chain genes were assessed. After 7 days of ammonia exposure, the broilers' weight in the ammonia group decreased. On the 21st day of the experiment, in the ammonia group, the breast muscle weight, thigh muscle weight, and dressed weight decreased, the blood urea nitrogen content increased, skeletal muscle fibre diameter shortened, the expression of myostatin increased, and the expression of myosin heavy chain-FWM and myosin heavy chain-FRM decreased significantly. This article suggests that 35 ppm atmospheric ammonia seriously affects the skeletal muscle gain rate of broilers, and the myostatin pathway could be a potential regulation of the growth rate of muscle fibre under ammonia exposure.",10.3390/ani13121926

They have various effects on plants, including plant growth promotion through the production of indole acetic acid (IAA), biological control activity (BCA), and production of cellulase enzymes, thus inducing systemic resistance and increasing the availability of mineral elements. The present work aimed to study the potential of Achromobacter marplatensis and Bacillus velezensis as plant probiotics for the field cultivation of potatoes. In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of selected probiotics to produce IAA and cellulase, as well as antimicrobial activity against two plant pathogens that infect Solanum tuberosum as Fusarium oxysporum and Ralstonia solanacearum under different conditions at a broad range of different temperatures and pH values. In vivo study of the effects of the probiotics A. marplatensis and B. velezensis on S. tuberosum plants grown in sandy clay loamy soil was detected after cultivation for 90 days. Probiotic isolates A. marplatensis and B. velezensis were able to tolerate ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure for up to two hours, the dose response curve exhibited that the D10 values of A. marplatensis and B. velezensis were 28 and 16 respectively. In the case of loading both probiotics with broth, the shoot dry weight was increased significantly from 28 in the control to 50 g, shoot length increased from 24 to 45.7 cm, branches numbers increased from 40 to 70 branch, leaves number increased from 99 to 130 leaf, root dry weight increased from 9.3 to 12.9 g, root length increased from 24 to 35.7 cm, tuber weight increased from 15 to 37.0 g and tubers number increased from 9 to 24.4 tuber, the rot percentage was reduced to 0%.

This study aimed to address these challenges by developing an injectable bioactive composite microsphere, termed D-P-Ak (polydopamine-PLGA-akermanite), designed to fit within the defect site while minimizing injury. The D-P-Ak microspheres biodegraded gradually, releasing calcium, magnesium, and silicon ions, which, notably, not only directly stimulated the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) but also activated sensory nerve cells to secrete calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a key factor in bone repair. Moreover, the released CGRP enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs through epigenetic methylation modification. Specifically, inhibition of EZH2 and enhancement of KDM6A reduced the trimethylation level of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27), thereby activating the transcription of osteogenic genes such as Runx2 and Osx. The efficacy of the bioactive microspheres in bone repair is validated in a rat mandibular defect model, demonstrating that peripheral nerve response facilitates bone regeneration through epigenetic modification. These findings illuminated a novel strategy for constructing neuroactive osteo-inductive biomaterials with potential for further clinical applications.",10.1002/advs.202400242

Our previous studies have found that exogenous trehalose treatment can alleviate the CI symptoms of peach by increasing sucrose accumulation. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential molecular mechanism of trehalose treatment in alleviating CI in postharvest peach fruit. Transcriptome analysis showed that trehalose induced gene expression in pathways of plant MAPK signaling, calcium signaling, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis indicated that PpCDPK24 may activate the ROS signaling pathway by phosphorylating PpRBOHE. Besides, PpWRKY40 mediates the activation of PpMAPKKK2-induced ROS signaling pathway by interacting with the PpRBOHE promoter. Accordingly, trehalose treatment significantly enhanced the activities of antioxidant-related enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and gluathione reductase (GR), as well as the transcription levels AsA-GSH cycle related gene, which led to the reduction of H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in peach during cold storage. In summary, our results suggest that the potential molecular mechanism of trehalose treatment is to enhance antioxidant capacity by activating CDPK-mediated Ca2 + -ROS signaling pathway and WRKY-mediated MAPK-WRKY-ROS signaling pathway, thereby reducing the CI in peach fruit.",10.1016/j.foodres.2024.114331

Carnosine, a natural bioactive dipeptide derived from meat muscle, possesses strong antioxidant properties. Dexamethasone, widely employed for treating various inflammatory diseases, raises concerns regarding its detrimental effects on bone health. This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of carnosine against dexamethasone-induced oxidative stress and bone impairment, along with its underlying mechanisms, utilizing chick embryos and a zebrafish model in vivo, as well as MC3T3-E1 cells in vitro.


RESULTS
Our findings revealed that carnosine effectively mitigated bone injury in dexamethasone-exposed chick embryos, accompanied by reduced oxidative stress. Further investigation demonstrated that carnosine alleviated impaired osteoblastic differentiation in MC3T3-E1 cells and zebrafish by suppressing the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). Moreover, mechanistic studies elucidated that carnosine promoted the expression and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), thereby facilitating the transcription of its downstream antioxidant response elements, including heme oxyense-1 (HO-1), glutamate cysteine ligase modifier (GCLM), and glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC) to counteract dexamethasone-induced oxidative stress.

Our results demonstrated that exposure of the whiteleg Shrimp to MPs and HBCD for 4 weeks resulted in evident histological injury in the hepatopancreas and marked elevation in hepatic lesion markers (Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) in the hemolymph,Shrimp,Alanine,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,"Toxicities of polystyrene microplastics (MPs) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), alone or in combination, to the hepatopancreas of the whiteleg shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei.","The hepatopancreas is one of the largest organs playing crucial roles in metabolism and detoxification in crustacean invertebrates. Although toxicities have been increasingly documented for the two ubiquitous pollutants, hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) and microplastics (MPs), in model animals, little is known about their impacts on the hepatopancreas of crustaceans. To fill this knowledge gap, the effects of MPs and HBCD, alone or in combination, on the hepatopancreas were evaluated in a commercially important crustacean species (the whiteleg shrimp) by histological observation as well as quantification of hepatic lesion-, metabolism-, and detoxification-related parameters. In addition, to reveal potential mechanisms underlying the hepatoxicity observed, the accumulation of HBCD in the shrimp and the status of oxidative stress were also investigated. Our results demonstrated that exposure of the whiteleg shrimp to MPs and HBCD for 4 weeks resulted in evident histological injury in the hepatopancreas and marked elevation in hepatic lesion markers (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) in the hemolymph. Moreover, both metabolism (activity of phosphofructokinase, contents of lactic acid and adenosine triphosphate, and expression of metabolism-related genes) and detoxification (contents of cytochrome P450, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, and glutathione, activity of glutathione S-transferase, and expression of detoxification-related genes) were found to be disrupted by the pollutants tested. In addition, exposure to MPs and HBCD also led to alterations in the contents and/or activities of antioxidant enzymes and resulted in oxidative damage to the hepatopancreas (indicated by marked elevation in malondialdehyde content). Furthermore, a significant amount of HBCD accumulated in shrimp treated with HBCD-containing seawater. The data also illustrated that HBCD-MP coexposure was more toxic than single exposure to these pollutants. These findings suggest that MPs and HBCD may exert hepatotoxic impacts on whiteleg shrimp by accumulating in vivo and inducing oxidative stress, which could pose a severe threat to the health of this important crustacean species.",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121646
"Most notably, chronic injury was associated with increased levels of multiple Amino acids including Alanine, aspartate, lysine, and proline",Amino acids,Alanine,Component-Whole,component-whole,Acute tear versus chronic-degenerated rotator cuff pathologies are associated with divergent tendon metabolite profiles.,"PURPOSE/AIM
Metabolic disorders are risk factors for rotator cuff injuries, which suggests that the rotator cuff is sensitive to local metabolic fluctuations. However, the link between the metabolic microenvironment and pathologic features of acute tear versus chronic degeneration is currently unknown. The overarching goal of this study was to evaluate alterations in tendon metabolite profiles following acute tear or chronic degeneration of the rotator cuff. We hypothesized that injury types (acute tear vs. chronic degeneration) would result in distinct metabolite profiles relative to clinically unaffected tendon controls.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We utilized untargeted metabolomics to identify pathways that were altered at the time of rotator cuff repair (RCR; acute tear) or reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA; chronic degeneration) relative to total shoulder arthroplasty controls (TSA; tendon clinically unaffected).


RESULTS
Acute tears to the rotator cuff were associated with an overall decrease in tendon metabolites. This global decrease was primarily associated with glycolic acid and decreased tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity. Conversely, chronic tendon specimens from patients undergoing rTSA showed an overall increase in metabolites. Most notably, chronic injury was associated with increased levels of multiple amino acids including alanine, aspartate, lysine, and proline.


CONCLUSIONS
Overall, this study demonstrates that distinct metabolite profiles are associated with injury types, and that therapeutic strategies should address both cellular and matrix components regardless of injury induction. The specific pathways identified paired with validated, established, treatment methods may serve as novel therapeutic targets for patients who suffer from rotator cuff injuries.",10.1080/03008207.2024.2425867

L. fusca plants were exposed to drought stress (100%, 70%, and 30% field capacity), and biochar (BC), as an organic soil amendment was applied in two concentrations (15 and 30 mg kg-1 soil) to induce drought tolerance. Our results demonstrated that drought restricted the growth of L. fusca by inhibiting shoot and root (fresh and dry) weight, total chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate. Under drought stress, the uptake of essential nutrients was also limited due to lower water supply, which ultimately affected metabolites including amino and organic acids, and soluble sugars. In addition, drought stress induced oxidative stress, which is evidenced by the higher production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide ion (O2-), hydroxyl ion (OH-), and malondialdehyde (MDA). The current study revealed that stress-induced oxidative injury is not a linear path, since the excessive production of lipid peroxidation led to the accumulation of methylglyoxal (MG), a member of reactive carbonyl species (RCS), which ultimately caused cell injury. As a consequence of oxidative-stress induction, the ascorbate-glutathione (AsA-GSH) pathway, followed by a series of reactions, was activated by the plants to reduce ROS-induced oxidative damage. Furthermore, biochar considerably improved plant growth and development by mediating metabolites and soil physio-chemical status.",10.3390/metabo13040511
"Inhibition of BTK using Ibrutinib led to reduced neurological deficits, perihematomal edema, brain Water content and blood-brain barrier disruption",Ibrutinib,Water,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Inhibition of Bruton's tyrosine kinase restricts neuroinflammation following intracerebral hemorrhage.,"Background: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating form of stroke with a lack of effective treatments. Following disease onset, ICH activates microglia and recruits peripheral leukocytes into the perihematomal region to amplify neural injury. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) controls the proliferation and survival of various myeloid cells and lymphocytes. However, the role of BTK in neuroinflammation and ICH injury remains poorly understood. Methods: Peripheral blood samples were collected from ICH patients and healthy controls to measure BTK expression profile in immune cell subsets. C57BL/6 mice were used to measure BTK expression and the activity of immune cell subsets following ICH induction. Neurological tests, brain water content, Evans blue leakage, MRI were used to assess the therapeutic effects of ibrutinib on ICH injury. Flow cytometry was used to investigate immune cell infiltration and microglial activity. Microglia were depleted using a CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622. Gr-1+ myeloid cells and B cells were depleted using monoclonal antibodies. Microglia-like BV2 cells were cultured to test the effects of BTK inhibition on these cells. Results: In humans and mice, we found that BTK was remarkably upregulated in myeloid cells after ICH. Inhibition of BTK using ibrutinib led to reduced neurological deficits, perihematomal edema, brain water content and blood-brain barrier disruption. BTK inhibition suppressed the inflammatory activity of microglia and brain infiltration of leukocytes. In contrast, BTK inhibition did not alter the counts of peripheral immune cells other than B cells. Further, the depletion of microglia or Gr-1+ myeloid cells ablated the protective effects of BTK inhibition against ICH injury. Notably, the depletion of B cells did not alter the protective effects of BTK inhibition against ICH injury. This suggests that the benefit of BTK inhibition in ICH mainly involves its impact on microglia and Gr-1+ myeloid cells. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that BTK inhibition attenuates neuroinflammation and ICH injury, which warrants further investigation as a potential therapy for ICH.",10.7150/thno.101024
"We believe that the cause of Nitrite-negative results is a lack of dietary Nitrate, dilution of urine and exogenous interference (e.g",Nitrite,Nitrate,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Nitrite-negative results in urinary tract infection by Enterobacterales: does the nitrite dipstick test have low sensitivity?,"Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections among humans. Urine culture is the gold standard diagnostic method for UTI; however, the dipstick test for nitrite is a widely used method signalling the presence of urinary nitrate-reducing bacteria. Unlike the gold standard, the dipstick test is easy to perform, while it is also less time-consuming and less expensive, and produces a result in a few minutes. This study investigates the sensitivity of the dipstick test for nitrite compared with the Griess test in urine samples from UTI caused by Enterobacterales species. We used the Griess test, which is the gold standard in nitrite measurement, to determine the sensitivity of the nitrite dipstick test. Semiquantitative urine culture was performed using standard procedures, and Enterobacterales identification was performed by manual conventional biochemical tests. In the first sample selection, 3 % (8/267) of urine samples suspected of UTI, analysed from March to April 2016, were nitrite-negative by dipstick test but positive for Enterobacterales in the urine culture. In the second sample selection, 5 % (2/44) of urine samples from October to December 2022 were also nitrite-negative but showed urine Enterobacterales isolation. All nitrite-negative dipstick results were consistent with the Griess test. Escherichia coli was the most prevalent bacterium, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, independent of sample selection. The dipstick test is a safe alternative for investigating nitrite in urine samples. We believe that the cause of nitrite-negative results is a lack of dietary nitrate, dilution of urine and exogenous interference (e.g. ascorbic acid). These findings support the idea that standard urine culture is necessary to rule out UTI.",10.1099/jmm.0.001663

Plants contain a variety of bioactive compounds that provide them antimicrobial properties, which can be used to develop novel antibiotics. The current research evaluated the antibacterial activity of 6 medicinal plants Sphagneticola calendulacea (Chinese wedelia), Enydra fluctuans (Buffalo spinach), Chenopodium album (Goosefoot), Mentha arvensis (Wild mint), Mimosa diplotricha (Nila grass), and Averrhoa bilimbi (Cucumber tree) against Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)- causing pathogens (Staphylococcus spp., Proteus spp., Pseudmonas spp., Escherichia coli and Enterobacter spp.).


Methods
The bacterial contamination of these plants was evaluated by using their surface-washed water. The combined effects of commercially available antibiotics along with these medicinal plants were also tested. We used the solvent extraction method, conventional cell culture technique, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay, and disc diffusion method for our analysis.


Results
The surface-washed water was contaminated with variable bacteria. The plants displayed notable antibacterial activity against most of the tested bacteria. Ethanol and hot water extract of plants exhibited minimum inhibitory effects, while the methanol extract of plants showed very potent antibacterial activity against most of the bacteria with inhibitory zone diameter up to 14 mm. In the case of combined effects, the zone diameter increased up to 26 mm, which is a significant improvement compared to the individual plant extracts.


Interpretation
This data suggested that the combination of two antibacterial agents, one natural and the other synthetic, would be more efficient in the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacteria than a single monotherapy of either of the antibacterial agents.",10.1016/j.nmni.2022.101076

Loss of the pectin biosynthesizing enzyme GALACTURONOSYLTRANSFERASE 10 (GAUT10) leads to a short-root phenotype under sucrose-limited conditions. The present study focused on determining the specific contributions of GAUT10 to pectin composition in primary roots and the underlying defects associated with gaut10 roots. Using live-cell microscopy, we determined reduced root growth in gaut10 is due to a reduction in both root apical meristem size and epidermal cell elongation. In addition, GAUT10 was required for normal pectin and hemicellulose composition in primary Arabidopsis roots. Specifically, loss of GAUT10 led to a reduction in galacturonic acid and xylose in root cell walls and altered the presence of rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) and homogalacturonan (HG) polymers in the root. Transcriptomic analysis of gaut10 roots compared to wild type uncovered hundreds of genes differentially expressed in the mutant, including genes related to auxin metabolism and peroxisome function. Consistent with these results, both auxin signaling and metabolism were modified in gaut10 roots. The sucrose-dependent short-root phenotype in gaut10 was linked to β-oxidation based on hypersensitivity to indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and an epistatic interaction with TRANSPORTER OF IBA1 (TOB1). Altogether, these data support a growing body of evidence suggesting that pectin composition may influence auxin pathways and peroxisome activity.",10.1093/plphys/kiad465

Upon genotoxic stress, cells activate the DNA damage response to coordinate a complex network of signaling pathways aimed at preserving genomic integrity. Here, we reveal that Opi1 is important to modulate transcription in response to genotoxic stress. We find that cells lacking Opi1 exhibit hypersensitivity to genotoxins, along with a delayed G1-to-S-phase transition and decreased gamma-H2A levels. Transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing reveals that Opi1 plays a central role in modulating essential biological processes during methyl methanesulfonate (MMS)-associated stress, including repression of phospholipid biosynthesis and transduction of mating signaling. Moreover, Opi1 induces sulfate assimilation and amino acid metabolic processes, such as arginine and histidine biosynthesis and glycine catabolism. Furthermore, we observe increased mitochondrial DNA instability in opi1Δ cells upon MMS treatment. Notably, we show that constitutive activation of the transcription factor Ino2-Ino4 is responsible for genotoxin sensitivity in Opi1-deficient cells, and the production of inositol pyrophosphates by Kcs1 counteracts Opi1 function specifically during MMS-induced stress. Overall, our findings highlight Opi1 as a critical sensor of genotoxic stress in budding yeast, orchestrating gene expression to facilitate appropriate stress responses.",10.1093/genetics/iyad130
"RESULT
Of the 39 studies obtained in the review, two clinical trials were selected: one for Zanubrutinib and one for Ibrutinib",Zanubrutinib,Ibrutinib,Component-Whole,component-whole,Adjusted indirect comparison of zanubrutinib and ibrutinib in first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to perform an adjusted indirect treatment comparison, according to the cytogenetic profile, in terms of efficacy between different Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors used as first-line monotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Safety outcomes considered of interest were also evaluated to establish whether these options can be considered equivalent therapeutic alternatives.


METHOD
A literature search was conducted in Pubmed and Embase on 10 November 2022 for phase III clinical trials studying Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors in monotherapy in the first-line setting for CLL. Results were filtered according to whether the combination of bendamustine and rituximab was used as comparator and whether they had similar populations and follow-up times. Subgroup results were meta-analyzed according to mutational characteristics by classifying patients into high and low cytogenetic risk. An adjusted indirect comparison was developed using Bucher's method. Possible therapeutic equivalence was determined by applying the guide to equivalent therapeutic alternatives.


RESULT
Of the 39 studies obtained in the review, two clinical trials were selected: one for zanubrutinib and one for ibrutinib. The remaining studies were not included because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. The results obtained in the adjusted indirect treatment comparison for both cytogenetic risk subgroups showed no statistically significant differences. The most relevant safety differences were auricular fibrillation, hypertension and cardiovascular events in patients treated with ibrutinib and higher incidence of secondary cancers in patients treated with zanubrutinib. Applying the ATE guideline criteria, both treatments cannot be considered equivalent therapeutic alternatives.


CONCLUSIONS
Assuming the uncertainty associated with the adjusted indirect comparison, zanubrutinib could be considered equivalent in efficacy to ibrutinib, however, the presence of differentiating safety features precludes assigning the two alternatives as equivalent therapeutic alternatives.",10.1016/j.farma.2023.07.006

The availability of selenium as a micronutrient and the subsequent biosynthesis of selenoproteins, containing the 21st amino acid selenocysteine (Sec), are important for the physiological functions of macrophages. Selenoproteins regulate the redox tone in macrophages during inflammation, the early onset of which involves oxidative burst of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. SELENOW is a highly expressed selenoprotein in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Beyond its described general role as a thiol and peroxide reductase and as an interacting partner for 14-3-3 proteins, its cellular functions, particularly in macrophages, remain largely unknown. In this study, we utilized Selenow knock-out (KO) murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) to address the role of SELENOW in inflammation following stimulation with bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). RNAseq-based temporal analyses of expression of selenoproteins and the Sec incorporation machinery genes suggested no major differences in the selenium utilization pathway in the Selenow KO BMDMs compared to their wild-type counterparts. However, selective enrichment of oxidative stress-related selenoproteins and increased ROS in Selenow-/- BMDMs indicated anomalies in redox homeostasis associated with hierarchical expression of selenoproteins. Selenow-/- BMDMs also exhibited reduced expression of arginase-1, a key enzyme associated with anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotype necessary to resolve inflammation, along with a significant decrease in efferocytosis of neutrophils that triggers pathways of resolution. Parallel targeted metabolomics analysis also confirmed an impairment in arginine metabolism in Selenow-/- BMDMs. Furthermore, Selenow-/- BMDMs lacked the ability to enhance characteristic glycolytic metabolism during inflammation. Instead, these macrophages atypically relied on oxidative phosphorylation for energy production when glucose was used as an energy source. These findings suggest that SELENOW expression in macrophages may have important implications on cellular redox processes and bioenergetics during inflammation and its resolution.",10.1016/j.redox.2022.102571

Therefore, tryptophan supplementation could be a promising way to protect the intestine health under the condition of long photoperiod.",10.1016/j.psj.2024.103509
"Together, our findings provide insight into HSP functions in Wheat and two novel candidate genes for improvement of Wheat varieties.",functions in Wheat,improvement of Wheat,Component-Whole,cause-effect,"Heat shock protein TaHSP17.4, a TaHOP interactor in wheat, improves plant stress tolerance.","Adaptation to drought and salt stresses is a fundamental part of plant cell physiology and is of great significance for crop production under environmental stress. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are molecular chaperones that play a crucial role in folding, assembling, translocating, and degrading proteins. However, their underlying mechanisms and functions in stress tolerance remain elusive. Here, we identified the HSP TaHSP17.4 in wheat by analyzing the heat stress-induced transcriptome. Further analysis showed that TaHSP17.4 was significantly induced under drought, salt, and heat stress treatments. Intriguingly, yeast-two-hybrid analysis showed that TaHSP17.4 interacts with the HSP70/HSP90 organizing protein (HOP) TaHOP, which plays a significant role in linking HSP70 and HSP90. We found that TaHSP17.4- and TaHOP-overexpressing plants have a higher proline content and a lower malondialdehyde content than wild-type plants under stress conditions and display strong tolerance to drought, salt, and heat stress. Additionally, qRT-PCR analysis showed that stress-responsive genes relevant to reactive oxygen species scavenging and abscisic acid signaling pathways were significantly induced in TaHSP17.4- and TaHOP-overexpressing plants under stress conditions. Together, our findings provide insight into HSP functions in wheat and two novel candidate genes for improvement of wheat varieties.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.125694

The identification and functional characterization of drought tolerance-related genes is thus vital for efforts to support the genetic improvement of drought-tolerant crops. Barley is highly adaptable and renowned for its robust stress resistance, making it an ideal subject for efforts to explore genes related to drought tolerance. In this study, two barley materials with different drought tolerance were subjected to soil drought treatment, including a variety with strong drought tolerance (Hindmarsh) and a genotype with weaker drought tolerance (XZ5). Transcriptomic sequencing data from the aboveground parts of these plants led to the identification of 1,206 differentially expressed genes associated with drought tolerance. These genes were upregulated in Hindmarsh following drought stress exposure but downregulated or unchanged in XZ5 under these same conditions, or were unchanged in Hindmarsh but downregulated in XZ5. Pathway enrichment analyses suggested that these genes are most closely associated with defense responses, signal recognition, photosynthesis, and the biosynthesis of various secondary metabolites. Using protein-protein interaction networks, the ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 17-like isoform X2 was predicted to impact other drought tolerance-related protein targets in Hindmarsh. In MapMan metabolic pathway analyses, genes found to be associated with the maintenance of drought tolerance in Hindmarsh under adverse conditions were predicted to include genes involved in the abscisic acid, cytokinin, and gibberellin phytohormone signaling pathways, genes associated with redox homeostasis related to ascorbate and glutathione S-transferase, transporters including ABC and AAAP, transcription factors such as AP2/ERF and bHLH, the heat shock proteins HSP60 and HSP70, and the sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase. Heterologous HvSnRK2 (one of the identified genes, which encodes the sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase) gene expression in yeast conferred significant drought tolerance, highlighting the functional importance of this gene as one linked with drought tolerance. This study revealed the drought tolerance mechanism of Hindmarsh by comparing transcriptomes while also providing a set of candidate genes for genetic efforts to improve drought tolerance in this and other crop species.",10.3389/fgene.2024.1524118

While the determination of the channel activity generally depends on heterologous expression of AQPs in Xenopus oocytes or yeast cells, we established a genetic tool to determine whether they facilitate the diffusion of H2 O2 through the plasma membrane in living plant cells. We designed genetic constructs to co-express the fluorescent H2 O2 sensor HyPer and AQPs, with expression controlled by a heat shock-inducible promoter in Nicotiana tabacum BY-2 suspension cells. After induction of ZmPIP2;5 AQP expression, a HyPer signal was recorded when the cells were incubated with H2 O2 , suggesting that ZmPIP2;5 facilitates H2 O2 transmembrane diffusion; in contrast, the ZmPIP2;5W85A mutated protein was inactive as a water or H2 O2 channel. ZmPIP2;1, ZmPIP2;4 and AtPIP2;1 also facilitated H2 O2 diffusion. Incubation with abscisic acid and the elicitor flg22 peptide induced the intracellular H2 O2 accumulation in BY-2 cells expressing ZmPIP2;5. We also monitored cation channel activity of ZmPIP2;5 using a novel fluorescent photo-switchable Li+ sensor in BY-2 cells.

Its distinct indole ring and high carbon content enable it to generate various biologically active metabolites such as serotonin, kynurenine (Kyn), and indole-3-pyruvate (I3P). Dysregulation of Trp metabolism has been implicated in diseases ranging from depression to cancer. Investigating Trp and its metabolites in healthy tissues offers pathways to target disease-associated disruptions selectively, while preserving essential functions. In this study, we comprehensively mapped Trp metabolites across the Kyn, serotonin, and I3P pathways, as well as the microbiome-derived metabolite tryptamine, in C57BL/6 mice. Our comprehensive analysis covered 12 peripheral organs, the central nervous system, and serum in both male and female mice at three life stages: young (3 weeks), adult (54 weeks), and aged (74 weeks). We found significant tissue-, sex-, and age-specific variations in Trp metabolism, with notably higher levels of the oncometabolites I3P and Kyn in aging males. These findings emphasize the value of organ-specific analysis of Trp metabolism for understanding its role in disease progression and identifying targeted therapeutic opportunities.


AUTHOR SUMMARY
Trp metabolism has primarily been studied in cell lines, often leading to generalized assumptions about its role in health and disease. However, how Trp and its metabolites are allocated across tissues, sexes, and life stages has remained poorly understood. This gap is critical, as Trp is the largest amino acid, minimally used for protein synthesis, and largely metabolized in the liver, yet its distribution and metabolism in other tissues are unknown. Misconceptions, such as the idea that all cancers universally increase Kyn production, have contributed to therapeutic failures, highlighting the need for rigorous, tissue-specific studies. Our study systematically quantifies Trp metabolites across organs and tissues in vivo, revealing significant organ-, sex-, and age-specific variations. These findings provide a foundational resource for understanding Trp metabolism in normal physiology and disease, with potential applications in cancer, neurodegeneration, and other metabolic disorders.",10.1101/2024.12.23.630041
"The newer integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), such as bictegravir and dolutegravir, especially when co-administered with Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF), seem to lead to greater weight increases compared to regimens that include Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), which seem to have an attenuating effect on weight gain",co-administered with Tenofovir,that include Tenofovir,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Weight Gain in HIV Adults Receiving Antiretroviral Treatment: Current Knowledge and Future Perspectives.,"Body weight is impacted by several individual host and environmental factors. In a person living with HIV (PLWH), weight is also influenced by the disease stage. Wasting syndrome is derived from disease progression, and it can be reversed by the effective use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Body weight alterations have been studied and compared in several clinical ART trials, and they differ according to antiviral regimens. The newer integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), such as bictegravir and dolutegravir, especially when co-administered with tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF), seem to lead to greater weight increases compared to regimens that include tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), which seem to have an attenuating effect on weight gain. Nevertheless, despite the established association between INSTI and TAF and the negative impact on weight, more recent data suggest a more cautious approach when HAART treatment decisions are taken. In this manuscript, we review weight changes among PLWH receiving HAART and the relevant underlying pathogenic mechanisms described in recent literature. We try to provide a more critical appraisal of the available data and to underline the challenges in assessing the role of HAART in weight changes in both ART initiation and setting switching.",10.3390/life14111367

We report here a real-world experience of 200 cases of RRMM treated with EloPd in 35 Italian centers outside of clinical trials. In our dataset, the median number of prior lines of therapy was two, with 51% of cases undergoing autologous stem cell transplant and 73% having been exposed to daratumumab. After a median follow-up of 9 months, 126 patients had stopped EloPd, most of them (88.9%) because of disease progression. The overall response rate was 55.4%, a finding in line with the pivotal trial results. Regarding adverse events, the toxicity profile in our cohort was similar to that in the ELOQUENT-3 trial, with no significant differences between younger (<70 years) and older patients. The median progression-free survival was 7 months, which was shorter than that observed in ELOQUENT-3, probably because of the different clinical characteristics of the two cohorts. Interestingly, International Staging System stage III disease was associated with worse progression-free survival (hazard ratio=2.55). Finally, the median overall survival of our series was shorter than that observed in the ELOQUENT-3 trial (17.5 vs. 29.8 months).

The cross-adaptation of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and triticale (×Triticosecale Wittm.) exposed to two environmental abiotic stressors (drought and waterlogging) was evaluated after treatment with a selective herbicide (Serrate®, Syngenta). The ambivalent effects of the herbicide on the two studied crops were particularly distinct in waterlogged plants, showing a significant reduction in wheat growth and better performance of triticale individuals exposed to the same combined treatment. Histochemical staining for the detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS) confirmed that the herbicide treatment increased the accumulation of superoxide anion in the flooded wheat plants, and this effect persisted in the younger leaves of the recovered individuals. Comparative transcript profiling of ROS scavenging enzymes (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase) in stressed and recovered plants revealed crop-specific variations resulting from the unfavorable water regimes in combination with the herbicide treatment. Short-term dehydration was relatively well tolerated by the hybrid crop triticale and this aligned with the considerable upregulation of genes for L-Proline biosynthesis. Its drought resilience was diminished by herbicide application, as evidenced by increased ROS accumulation after prolonged water deprivation.",10.3390/ijms241512503

"To define the temperature influence on Grape physiology and composition during postharvest dehydration, the withering of the red-skin grape cultivar Corvina (Vitis vinifera) was studied in two conditioned rooms set at distinct temperatures and at varying relative humidity to maintain an equal grape Water loss rate",Grape,Water,Component-Whole,cause-effect,"Temperature affects organic acid, terpene and stilbene metabolisms in wine grapes during postharvest dehydration.","The partial dehydration of grapes after harvest is a traditional practice in several winegrowing regions that leads to the production of high quality wines. Postharvest dehydration (also known as withering) has a significant impact on the overall metabolism and physiology of the berry, yielding a final product that is richer in sugars, solutes, and aroma compounds. These changes are, at least in part, the result of a stress response, which is controlled at transcriptional level, and are highly dependent on the grape water loss kinetics and the environmental parameters of the facility where grapes are stored to wither. However, it is difficult to separate the effects driven by each single environmental factor from those of the dehydration rate, especially discerning the effect of temperature that greatly affects the water loss kinetics. To define the temperature influence on grape physiology and composition during postharvest dehydration, the withering of the red-skin grape cultivar Corvina (Vitis vinifera) was studied in two conditioned rooms set at distinct temperatures and at varying relative humidity to maintain an equal grape water loss rate. The effect of temperature was also studied by withering the grapes in two unconditioned facilities located in geographic areas with divergent climates. Technological, LC-MS and GC-MS analyses revealed higher levels of organic acids, flavonols, terpenes and cis- and trans-resveratrol in the grapes withered at lower temperature conditions, whereas higher concentrations of oligomeric stilbenes were found in the grapes stored at higher temperatures. Lower expression of the malate dehydrogenase and laccase, while higher expression of the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, stilbene synthase and terpene synthase genes were detected in the grapes withered at lower temperatures.

"However, Wheat is almost invariably processed before it is consumed, usually via baking and/or toasting, and this can lead to the formation of toxic processing contaminants, including acrylamide, 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)",Wheat,5-Hydroxymethylfurfural,Component-Whole,cause-effect,Reducing the Risk of Acrylamide and Other Processing Contaminant Formation in Wheat Products.,"Wheat is a staple crop, consumed worldwide as a major source of starch and protein. Global intake of wheat has increased in recent years, and overall, wheat is considered to be a healthy food, particularly when products are made from whole grains. However, wheat is almost invariably processed before it is consumed, usually via baking and/or toasting, and this can lead to the formation of toxic processing contaminants, including acrylamide, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Acrylamide is principally formed from free (soluble, non-protein) asparagine and reducing sugars (glucose, fructose and maltose) within the Maillard reaction and is classified as a Group 2A carcinogen (probably carcinogenic to humans). It also has neurotoxic and developmental effects at high doses. HMF is also generated within the Maillard reaction but can also be formed via the dehydration of fructose or caramelisation. It is frequently found in bread, biscuits, cookies, and cakes. Its molecular structure points to genotoxicity and carcinogenic risks. PAHs are a large class of chemical compounds, many of which are genotoxic, mutagenic, teratogenic and carcinogenic. They are mostly formed during frying, baking and grilling due to incomplete combustion of organic matter. Production of these processing contaminants can be reduced with changes in recipe and processing parameters, along with effective quality control measures. However, in the case of acrylamide and HMF, their formation is also highly dependent on the concentrations of precursors in the grain. Here, we review the synthesis of these contaminants, factors impacting their production and the mitigation measures that can be taken to reduce their formation in wheat products, focusing on the role of genetics and agronomy. We also review the risk management measures adopted by food safety authorities around the world.",10.3390/foods12173264
"The Oxygen-containing functional groups in Soybean straw were stripped, and a trend of dehydration was observed as the temperature increased during the MHT process",Oxygen,Soybean,Component-Whole,component-whole,Fundamental properties and phosphorus transformation mechanism of soybean straw during microwave hydrothermal conversion process.,"Microwave hydrothermal (MHT) conversion is emerging as a promising technology for the disposal and reutilization of biowastes. This study investigated the fundamental properties and phosphorus transformation mechanism of soybean straw during the MHT conversion process. The oxygen-containing functional groups in soybean straw were stripped, and a trend of dehydration was observed as the temperature increased during the MHT process. Cellulose was identified as the major component of the MHT solid products at high temperature. Glucose and glucuronic acid in the MHT liquid products were gradually converted to formic acid and acetic acid with increasing temperature and holding time. The characteristics of the MHT products directly affected the changes in P speciation and transformation. Most of the P was distributed in liquid products and the impact of holding time was not significant on P distribution at low MHT temperature. With the increase in temperature and holding time, P gradually transferred into the solid products. The proportion of organic phosphorus and soluble inorganic phosphorus in soybean straw was high, and it decreased noticeably after the MHT process. The increase in MHT temperature promoted the conversion of OP and AP into IP and NAIP respectively. P K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure analysis reveals that Ca5(PO4)3(OH) was the major component of soybean straw and more Ca5(PO4)3(OH) was formed at lower MHT temperature.

"Methods
Two cohorts of male rats were used: in cohort 1, rats received one intraperitoneal (ip) injection of saline or Cisplatin (2 mg kg-1 week-1) on the first day of weeks 1-5; in cohort 2, rats received two cycles of five daily ip injections (Monday to Friday, weeks 1-2) of saline or Vincristine (0.1 mg kg-1 day-1)",Cisplatin,Vincristine,Component-Whole,cause-effect,Contractility of isolated colonic smooth muscle strips from rats treated with cancer chemotherapy: differential effects of cisplatin and vincristine.,"Background
Certain antineoplastic drugs cause gastrointestinal disorders even after the end of treatment. Enteric neuropathy has been associated with some of these alterations. Our goal was to assess the impact of repeated treatment with cisplatin and vincristine on the contractility of circular and longitudinal muscle strips isolated from the rat colon.


Methods
Two cohorts of male rats were used: in cohort 1, rats received one intraperitoneal (ip) injection of saline or cisplatin (2 mg kg-1 week-1) on the first day of weeks 1-5; in cohort 2, rats received two cycles of five daily ip injections (Monday to Friday, weeks 1-2) of saline or vincristine (0.1 mg kg-1 day-1). Body weight and food and water intake were monitored throughout the study. One week after treatment, responses of colonic smooth muscle strips to acetylcholine (10-9-10-5 M) and electrical field stimulation (EFS, 0.1-20 Hz), before and after atropine (10-6 M), were evaluated in an organ bath.


Results
Both drugs decreased body weight gain. Compared to saline, cisplatin significantly decreased responses of both longitudinal and circular smooth muscle strips to EFS, whereas vincristine tended to increase them, although in a non-significant manner. No differences were observed in the muscle response to acetylcholine. Atropine abolished the contractile responses induced by acetylcholine, although those induced by EFS were only partially reduced in the presence of atropine.


Conclusion
The findings suggest that although both drugs cause the development of enteric neuropathy, this seems to have a functional impact only in cisplatin-treated animals. Understanding the effects of chemotherapy on gastrointestinal motor function is vital for enhancing the quality of life of cancer patients.",10.3389/fnins.2023.1304609
"Notably, ABS emissions induced metabolic perturbation on Amino acids and energy metabolism, as well as redox-regulated pathways including Arginine, methionine, cysteine, and vitamin B3 metabolism, whereas PLA emissions exposures caused fatty acid and carnitine dysregulation",Amino acids,Arginine,Component-Whole,cause-effect,Real-Time Exposure to 3D-Printing Emissions Elicits Metabolic and Pro-Inflammatory Responses in Human Airway Epithelial Cells.,"Three-dimensional (3D) printer usage in household and school settings has raised health concerns regarding chemical and particle emission exposures during operation. Although the composition of 3D printer emissions varies depending on printer settings and materials, little is known about the impact that emissions from different filament types may have on respiratory health and underlying cellular mechanisms. In this study, we used an in vitro exposure chamber system to deliver emissions from two popular 3D-printing filament types, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA), directly to human small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) cultured in an air-liquid interface during 3D printer operation. Using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) and an optical particle sizer (OPS), we monitored 3D printer particulate matter (PM) emissions in terms of their particle size distribution, concentrations, and calculated deposited doses. Elemental composition of ABS and PLA emissions was assessed using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). Finally, we compared the effects of emission exposure on cell viability, inflammation, and metabolism in SAEC. Our results reveal that, although ABS filaments emitted a higher total concentration of particles and PLA filaments emitted a higher concentration of smaller particles, SAEC were exposed to similar deposited doses of particles for each filament type. Conversely, ABS and PLA emissions had distinct elemental compositions, which were likely responsible for differential effects on SAEC viability, oxidative stress, release of inflammatory mediators, and changes in cellular metabolism. Specifically, while ABS- and PLA-emitted particles both reduced cellular viability and total glutathione levels in SAEC, ABS emissions had a significantly greater effect on glutathione relative to PLA emissions. Additionally, pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1β, MMP-9, and RANTES were significantly increased due to ABS emissions exposure. While IL-6 and IL-8 were stimulated in both exposure scenarios, VEGF was exclusively increased due to PLA emissions exposures. Notably, ABS emissions induced metabolic perturbation on amino acids and energy metabolism, as well as redox-regulated pathways including arginine, methionine, cysteine, and vitamin B3 metabolism, whereas PLA emissions exposures caused fatty acid and carnitine dysregulation. Taken together, these results advance our mechanistic understanding of 3D-printer-emissions-induced respiratory toxicity and highlight the role that filament emission properties may play in mediating different respiratory outcomes.",10.3390/toxics12010067

In this report, extensive co-crystal screening of NOBs with 31 cocrystal formers (coformers) with various functional groups was carried out by the liquid-assisted grinding method. As a result, four cocrystals (NOB with urea (URE), oxalic acid, gallic acid and salicylic acid) and one solvate crystal (NOB with formic acid (FOR)) were found. Powder X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis revealed the unique crystal morphology of all the obtained samples. In addition, the crystal structures of two of them (NOB-URE and NOB-FOR) were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The results revealed that NOB-URE and NOB-FOR are new cocrystals or solvate crystals consisting of molar ratios of 1 : 2 and 1 : 0.73, respectively. In NOB-URE, we could observe a transient increase in solubility due to supersaturation, suggesting that URE is one of the better coformers of NOB.",10.1248/cpb.c23-00109
"For this purpose, we tested various molecules known to act on cell metabolism, and we revealed the anti-inflammatory effect of the FDA-approved piperazine derivative Ranolazine on microglia cells, while confirming the one of the flavonoids Quercetin and Naringenin, both in vitro and in vivo",Ranolazine,Quercetin,Component-Whole,cause-effect,Anti-inflammatory reprogramming of microglia cells by metabolic modulators to counteract neurodegeneration; a new role for Ranolazine.,"Microglia chronic activation is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including the retinal ones, possibly contributing to their etiopathogenesis. However, some microglia sub-populations have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective functions, thus making arduous deciphering the role of these cells in neurodegeneration. Since it has been proposed that functionally different microglia subsets also rely on different metabolic routes, we hypothesized that modulating microglia metabolism might be a tool to enhance their anti-inflammatory features. This would have a preventive and therapeutic potential in counteracting neurodegenerative diseases. For this purpose, we tested various molecules known to act on cell metabolism, and we revealed the anti-inflammatory effect of the FDA-approved piperazine derivative Ranolazine on microglia cells, while confirming the one of the flavonoids Quercetin and Naringenin, both in vitro and in vivo. We also demonstrated the synergistic anti-inflammatory effect of Quercetin and Idebenone, and the ability of Ranolazine, Quercetin and Naringenin to counteract the neurotoxic effect of LPS-activated microglia on 661W neuronal cells. Overall, these data suggest that using the selected molecules -also in combination therapies- might represent a valuable approach to reduce inflammation and neurodegeneration while avoiding long term side effects of corticosteroids.",10.1038/s41598-023-47540-8

"CONCLUSIONS
Caffeine exhibits potent neuroprotective effects against chronic high-altitude-induced cognitive impairments, potentially through its action on A2AR, leading to enhanced TH expression and subsequent release of Dopamine and its related neurotransmitters.",Caffeine,Dopamine,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Caffeine's Neuroprotective Effect on Memory Impairment: Suppression of Adenosine A2A Receptor and Enhancement of Tyrosine Hydroxylase in Dopaminergic Neurons Under Hypobaric Hypoxia Conditions.,"AIMS
Chronic hypobaric hypoxia frequently results in memory deficits, with severe cases showing marked alterations in dopamine levels and its metabolites. This research explores caffeine's modulation of the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) and its regulatory effects on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aiming to restore dopamine homeostasis and mitigate memory impairments associated with hypoxia. The goal is to identify novel preventive strategies against cognitive decline induced by hypoxia.


METHODS
Network pharmacological analysis was employed to predict the interactions between caffeine, cognitive function, and hypobaric hypoxia-related disorders. The novel object recognition and Y-maze tests were utilized to assess caffeine's impact on memory deficits under hypobaric hypoxia conditions in male mice. LC-MS/MS analysis was subsequently conducted to examine the variations in dopamine and its metabolites within the midbrain. Molecular docking further confirmed the binding affinities between A2AR and caffeine, as well as TH and caffeine. Additionally, immunofluorescence and protein-protein docking were employed to elucidate the interaction between A2AR and TH.


RESULTS
The findings highlight the pivotal role of adenosine receptors and dopamine-related pathways in the interplay between caffeine, cognition, and hypobaric hypoxia-related disorders. Behavioral tests demonstrated that caffeine effectively alleviated memory impairments caused by chronic hypobaric hypoxia. LC-MS/MS results revealed significant differences in dopamine, metanephrine, and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid levels following caffeine treatment for hypoxia-induced cognitive deficits. Molecular docking confirmed the high affinity between A2AR and caffeine, as well as TH and caffeine, while immunofluorescence and protein-protein docking provided insights into the A2AR-TH interaction and its modulation during hypobaric hypoxia.


CONCLUSIONS
Caffeine exhibits potent neuroprotective effects against chronic high-altitude-induced cognitive impairments, potentially through its action on A2AR, leading to enhanced TH expression and subsequent release of dopamine and its related neurotransmitters.",10.1111/cns.70134

The current study investigated whether nano-selenium (nano-Se) and nano-silica (nano-SiO2) could be used against the leaf spot disease caused by Alternaria alternata in a common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). The engineered Se and SiO2 nanoparticles were compared to a traditional fungicide and a negative control with no treatment, and experiments were repeated during two successive seasons in fields and in vitro. The in vitro study showed that 100 ppm nano-Se had an efficacy rate of 85.1% on A. alternata mycelial growth, followed by the combined applications (Se + SiO2 at half doses) with an efficacy rate of 77.8%. The field study showed that nano-Se and the combined application of nano-Se and nano-SiO2 significantly decreased the disease severity of A. alternata. There were no significant differences among nano-Se, the combined application, and the fungicide treatment (positive control). As compared to the negative control (no treatment), leaf weight increased by 38.3%, the number of leaves per plant by 25.7%, chlorophyll A by 24%, chlorophyll B by 17.5%, and total dry seed yield by 30%. In addition, nano-Se significantly increased the enzymatic capacity (i.e., CAT, POX, PPO) and antioxidant activity in the leaves. Our current study is the first to report that the selected nano-minerals are real alternatives to chemical fungicides for controlling A. alternata in common beans. This work suggests the potential of nanoparticles as alternatives to fungicides.

The global prevalence of macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MRMP) pneumonia infections, particularly in children, is on the rise. It is imperative to assess the clinical efficacies of alternative antibiotics such as tetracyclines to ensure effective treatment, mitigate antibiotic resistance, enhance clinical outcomes, and minimize the spread of resistant strains among MRMP-infected children. The objective of this study was to compare the therapeutic efficacies of macrolides and tetracyclines in treating MRMP pneumonia in children.


METHODS
We systematically searched the literature to identify comparative studies that examined the clinical outcomes of macrolide and tetracycline antibiotics in children with MRMP pneumonia. We conducted a meta-analysis of the mean duration of fever, hospital stay duration, therapeutic efficacies, and time to defervescence to compare macrolides and tetracyclines.


RESULTS
Eleven studies involving 1143 patients compared the clinical efficacies of macrolides and tetracyclines in children with MRMP pneumonia. The studies were conducted in China, Japan, and Korea, and the outcomes of febrile days, hospital stay duration, therapeutic efficacy, and time to defervescence were analyzed. The macrolides studied were azithromycin and clarithromycin, whereas the tetracyclines included minocycline and doxycycline.

However, research on super-high-molecular-weight or -viscosity γ-PGA is limited. In this study, the pgdS gene in Bacillus licheniformis WX-02 was knocked out using homologous recombination, and the batch fermentation performances of the recombinant strain WX-ΔpgdS were compared to those of WX-02. Nitrate accumulation was observed in the early fermentation stages of WX-ΔpgdS, and gene transcription analysis and cell morphology observations revealed that nitrite accumulation was caused by oxygen limitation due to cell aggregation. When the aeration and agitation rates were increased to 2.5 vvm and 600 r/min, respectively, and citrate was used as a precursor, nitrite accumulation was alleviated in WX-ΔpgdS fermentation broth, while γ-PGA yield and broth viscosity reached 17.3 g/L and 4988 mPa·s.

One potentially effective strategy to mitigate pesticide toxicity involves dietary intervention by supplementing exogenous amino acids and their derivates to augment the body's antioxidant capacity and mitigate pesticide-induced oxidative harm, whose mechanism including bolstering glutathione synthesis, regulating arginine-NO metabolism, mitochondria-related oxidative stress, and the open of ion channels, as well as enhancing intestinal microecology. Enhancing glutathione synthesis through supplementation of substrates N-acetylcysteine and glycine is regarded as a potent mechanism to achieve this. Selection of appropriate amino acids or their derivates for supplementation, and determining an appropriate dosage, are of the utmost importance for effective mitigation of pesticide-induced oxidative harm. More experimentation is required that involves large population samples to validate the efficacy of dietary intervention strategies, as well as to determine the effects of amino acids and their derivates on long-term and low-dose pesticide exposure. This review provides insights to guide future research aimed at preventing and alleviating pesticide toxicity through dietary intervention of amino acids and their derivates.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116340
"In addition, exogenous spermidine enhanced activities and gene expression of antioxidant enzymes in Barley seedlings under UV-B stress, including peroxidase, Glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase",Barley,Glutathione,Component-Whole,component-whole,Spermidine alleviates oxidative damage and enhances phenolic compounds accumulation in barley seedlings under UV-B stress.,"BACKGROUND
Ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation can enhance the accumulation of phenolic compounds (PCs) in barley seedling, although this may result in severe oxidative damage. In the present study, the role of spermidine in alleviating oxidative damage and regulating synthesis of PCs in barley seedlings under UV-B stress was investigated.


RESULTS
Exogenous spermidine increased the length and fresh weight as well as PCs contents of barley seedlings under UV-B stress. Application of dicyclohexylamine, an inhibitor of endogenous spermidine synthesis, significantly inhibited the growth and PC accumulation of barley seedlings under UV-B stress, although this inhibitory effect can be alleviated by exogenous spermidine. Exogenous spermidine increased the contents of vanillic acid, syringic acid, protocatechuic acid and p-coumaric acid in barley seedlings under UV-B stress by 20-200% through enhancing the activities of enzymes related to synthesis of these acids. In addition, exogenous spermidine enhanced activities and gene expression of antioxidant enzymes in barley seedlings under UV-B stress, including peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase.


CONCLUSION
Spermidine can alleviate oxidative damage of barley seedlings under UV-B stress and enhance the accumulation of PCs. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.",10.1002/jsfa.12176

Approximately 150,000 Canadian women live with epilepsy, a population that presents with unique challenges. Our objective was to capture demographic and real-world practice characteristics of Canadian healthcare professionals providing care for women with epilepsy (WWE) with specific focus on reproductive considerations to identify potential gaps in knowledge and care.


METHODS
A questionnaire developed by the Canadian League Against Epilepsy WWE workgroup was distributed to Canadian healthcare professionals from February 2021 to October 2022 to capture participant demographic characteristics and practice patterns in key areas of the reproductive cycle in WWE.


RESULTS
A total of 156 participants completed the questionnaire, most being physicians (81.4%), epilepsy specialists (69.0%), and those who cared for adult patients (86.5%), with a significant proportion based at an academic center (65.4%). The majority of participants counselled on folic acid supplementation (89.7%). Participants selected lamotrigine and levetiracetam most frequently for either focal or generalized epilepsies during pregnancy. Additionally, 85.9% performed therapeutic drug monitoring during pregnancy. Almost all practitioners always or often counseled WWE on valproic acid on the benefits of switching to a less teratogenic medication (96.2%). Some geographic variability in practice patterns was noted with valproic acid being one of the top three medications selected for patients with generalized epilepsies in Western regions, although participants in Eastern regions had brivaracetam more commonly included as one of their top three agents for this population.

However, the identities of most chromophores in these reactions and the effects of pH remain largely unknown. In this study, the chemical structures, formation pathways, and optical properties of individual BrC chromophores formed through aqueous reactions of α-dicarbonyls (glyoxal and methylglyoxal) with ammonium, amino acids, or methylamine at different pH's were characterized in detail by liquid chromatography-photodiode array-high resolution tandem mass spectrometry. In total, 180 chromophores are identified, accounting for 29-79% of the light absorption of bulk BrC for different reactions.

To develop effective mitigation strategies, it is critical to know the amount of the emitted particles. The purpose of this research is to estimate the temperature-dependent particle mass emission rates of edible oils and to develop models for source strength based on the multiple linear regression method. First, this study examined seven commonly used oils by heating experiments. The emission rates of PM2.5 and PM10 were measured, and the effects of parameters such as oil volume and surface area on the emission rates were also analysed. Following that, the starting smoke points (Ts') and aggravating smoke points (Tss') of tested oils were determined. The results showed that oils with lower smoke points had greater emission rates. Notably, the experiments performed observed that peanut, rice, rapeseed and olive oil generated PM2.5 much faster at 240 °C (2.22, 1.50, 0.82 and 0.80 mg/s, respectively, at the highest emission conditions) than that of sunflower, soybean, and corn oil (0.15, 0.12 and 0.11 mg/s, respectively). The temperature, volume, and surface area of oils all had a significant impact on the particle mass emission rate, with oil temperature being the most influential. The regression models obtained were statistically significant (P < 0.001), with the majority of R2 values greater than 0.85.

"RESULTS
For the first time, a crude digestive proteases preparation (CDPP) was obtained from Herring viscera using a two-stage method consisting of Ethanol extraction and then salt precipitation",Herring,Ethanol,Component-Whole,component-whole,Application of a crude digestive proteases preparation to improve the ripening of marinated fillets from low-technological value Baltic herring (Clupea harengus membras L.).,"BACKGROUND
As a result of climate change (reduced the oxygen content and food available in the waters) and overfishing, ever larger batches of the herring catch are classified as low-value fish and used for feedstuff or canned food production. Fast and complete ripening of marinated fillets, especially from low-value Baltic herring, poses a problem because of the low muscle protease activity and changes in muscle tissue proteins.


RESULTS
For the first time, a crude digestive proteases preparation (CDPP) was obtained from herring viscera using a two-stage method consisting of ethanol extraction and then salt precipitation. CDPP had a reduced hemoglobin content, with optimum activity at pH 7.5-8.8 or 60-120 g kg-1 NaCl. At pH 4-5, it still exhibited 24-68% of proteolytic activity. CDPP was used for 4-24 h of brining of fresh and frozen-thawed fillets or injection of fresh fillets before marinating. CDPP-brining increased especially cathepsin D and carboxypeptidase A activities, whereas it decreased cathepsin B and L activities in the marinades. CDPP-brining mitigated the negative effect of freezing-thawing on mass-yield, protease activity, protein hydrolysis, texture profile, colour and sensory quality of the marinated fillets. CDPP-injection was found to be the best method because it increased mass-yield and ripeness of the marinated fillets to a greater extent than CDPP-brining did. The marinades from the CDPP-treated fillets had no bitter taste as a result of the presence of hemoglobin or chymotrypsin, and there were no results indicating lipid oxidation.


CONCLUSION
The application of CDPP in marinating technology is a viable approach to enable the use of low-value herring in food production, shorten the marinating time, and improve the ripeness and sensory quality of meat. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",10.1002/jsfa.13358

Xylazine is a veterinary anesthetic increasingly present alongside illicit fentanyl in the US and Canada, presenting novel health risks. Although xylazine remains less common in the Western US, Mexican border cities serve as key trafficking hubs and may have higher prevalence of novel substances, but surveillance has been limited.


Methods
We examined deidentified records from the Prevencasa harm reduction clinic in Tijuana, describing urine and paraphernalia testing from patients reporting using illicit opioids within 24 hr. Xylazine (two types), fentanyl, opiate, methamphetamine, amphetamine, benzodiazepine, and nitazene test strips were used to test urine and paraphernalia samples. Paraphernalia samples were also analyzed with mass spectrometry.


Results
The study consisted of 23 participants that provided both urine and paraphernalia samples. Of the participants studied, 100 %, 91.3 %, and 69.6 % reported using China White/fentanyl, methamphetamine, and tar heroin, respectively. The mean age was 41.7 years, 95.7 % were male, 65.2 % were unhoused, and 30.4 % had skin wounds at the time of sample collection.Xylazine positivity in urine, for the two types used, was 82.6 % and 65.2 %. For paraphernalia testing, the xylazine positivity was 65.2 % and 47.8 %. Confirmatory testing of paraphernalia samples by mass spectrometry indicated a 52.2 % xylazine positivity. This testing also revealed positivity rates for fentanyl (73.9 %), fluorofentanyl (30.4 %), tramadol (30.4 %), and lidocaine (30.4 %).The mass spectrometry results suggest lidocaine triggered n = 3 and n = 0 false positives among the xylazine test strip types.

Xylazine (two types), fentanyl, opiate, methamphetamine, amphetamine, benzodiazepine, and nitazene test strips were used to test urine and paraphernalia samples. Paraphernalia samples were also analyzed with mass spectrometry.


Results
The study consisted of 23 participants that provided both urine and paraphernalia samples. Of the participants studied, 100 %, 91.3 %, and 69.6 % reported using China White/fentanyl, methamphetamine, and tar heroin, respectively. The mean age was 41.7 years, 95.7 % were male, 65.2 % were unhoused, and 30.4 % had skin wounds at the time of sample collection.Xylazine positivity in urine, for the two types used, was 82.6 % and 65.2 %. For paraphernalia testing, the xylazine positivity was 65.2 % and 47.8 %. Confirmatory testing of paraphernalia samples by mass spectrometry indicated a 52.2 % xylazine positivity. This testing also revealed positivity rates for fentanyl (73.9 %), fluorofentanyl (30.4 %), tramadol (30.4 %), and lidocaine (30.4 %).The mass spectrometry results suggest lidocaine triggered n = 3 and n = 0 false positives among the xylazine test strip types. A total of n = 0 and n = 1 false negatives were also observed.


Discussion
Xylazine is present on the U.S.-Mexico border, requiring public health intervention. High lidocaine positivity complicates the clinical detection of xylazine via testing strips. Xylazine was found to be more prevalent in urine than in paraphernalia samples. Confirmatory urine studies are needed to better understand possible complications of using test strips for toxicological testing.",10.1101/2024.08.19.24312273
"In this pilot study, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was prospectively collected from 26 NMOSD patients in relapse and 16 controls with noninflammatory diseases and 6 neurometabolites in the Tryptophan metabolic pathway, including 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), Kynurenine (KYN), melatonin (MLT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA), 3-hydroxy-o-aminobenzoic acid (3-HAA), and kynurenic acid (KYA), were measured by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS)",Tryptophan,Kynurenine,Component-Whole,component-whole,Decreased kynurenine in cerebrospinal fluid and potential role in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder.,"Tryptophan (Trp) metabolism has been implicated in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders, but its relationship with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is unclear. In this pilot study, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was prospectively collected from 26 NMOSD patients in relapse and 16 controls with noninflammatory diseases and 6 neurometabolites in the tryptophan metabolic pathway, including 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), kynurenine (KYN), melatonin (MLT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA), 3-hydroxy-o-aminobenzoic acid (3-HAA), and kynurenic acid (KYA), were measured by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The association of Trp metabolites with NMOSD and its clinical parameters was evaluated. The role of KYN, which is a Trp metabolite involved in the binding of NMOSD-IgG antibody to aquaporin 4 (AQP4), was also evaluated in vitro. CSF KYN was significantly decreased in patients with relapsing NMOSD compared to controls, and CSF KYN was associated with CSF white blood cells in NMOSD. In vitro experiments showed that NMOSD-IgG specifically recognized KYN, which reversed the NMOSD-IgG-induced downregulation of AQP4 expression. Our results show that abnormal Trp metabolism occurs in NMOSD and that KYN might be a potential target for the treatment of AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD patients.",10.1111/jnc.15772
"Red yeast Rice (RYR) is marketed as a dietary supplement because it contains natural 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), including monacolin K",Rice,Coenzyme A,Component-Whole,component-whole,Using stable carbon isotope ratio analysis to detect adulteration in red yeast rice dietary supplements.,"Red yeast rice (RYR) is marketed as a dietary supplement because it contains natural 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), including monacolin K. However, there is concern that some RYR supplements may be adulterated with the pharmaceutical drug lovastatin to enhance health claims. We have developed an optimized method to isolate monacolin K/lovastatin from complex RYR dietary supplement matrices to then test for adulteration in RYR supplements using stable carbon isotope (δ13C) analysis. Samples were initially screened for monacolin K/lovastatin using liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS). To ensure the extraction process did not affect the measured isotopic values (i.e., isotopic fractionation effects), neat lovastatin standards were spiked into two types of blank RYR matrices (powder and gel). The monacolin K/lovastatin peaks were detected using high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) and isolated using fraction collection. Residual matrix components were removed from targeted fractions by solid phase extraction (SPE) using graphitized carbon black cartridges. The resulting isolates were then analyzed using elemental analyzer-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA-IRMS) to measure δ13C values. The δ13C values of the extracted lovastatin standards were compared to their respective neat lovastatin δ13C values and demonstrated negligible isotopic fractionation effects. Using this optimized clean up method and carbon isotope analysis, thirty-one samples were screened. Eight RYR dietary supplement samples had >0.8 mg/g of monacolin K/lovastatin, our minimum threshold for analyzing samples using this method. Four of these eight samples had δ13C values greater than -28.3‰, a previously proposed cutoff value for natural monacolin K, indicating likely adulteration. Additionally, five RYR powder samples were analyzed as part of a collaborative study using in-house methods from two laboratories and the data shows acceptable agreement in the δ13C values of monacolin K/lovastatin (differences ranging from ±0.02‰ to ±0.76‰). This optimized method represents a robust, reproducible procedure for detecting lovastatin adulteration in dietary supplements with minimal isotopic fractionation.",10.1016/j.talanta.2023.125076

We aimed to develop a rapid, simple, and precise ultra performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) technique for simultaneous measurement of omadacycline (OMA) and tigecycline (TGC) in the bloodstream of individuals suffering from serious bacterial infections.


Methods
All analytes were extracted using a 0.2 % formic acid-water dilution and acetonitrile plasma protein precipitation. The quantification was performed by electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry with selected reaction monitoring and positive ion mode detection. Tetracycline was used as an internal standard in this experiment, with the mobile phase composed of water (with 0.1 % formic acid) and acetonitrile (using gradient elution) flowing at a rate of 0.35 ml/min, and the column temperature set at 30 °C. Each individual analysis was completed in under 3.5 min.


Results
The method was validated based on FDA recommendations, including the assessment of extraction recovery (92.65-101.72 %) and matrix effects (86.22-91.12 %). The standard curve ranges for both OMA and TGC are 0.025 µg/mL to 2.5 µg/mL. The plasma samples were found to be consistent after undergoing three rounds of freezing and thawing at room temperature for 24 h, being placed in an automated sample injector for 24 h, and then frozen for 45 days. Clinical cases were used to demonstrate the application of the therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) assay, showing how an analytical test can quickly provide information on antibiotic levels in patients and impact their treatment.

Although many studies have linked prenatal exposure to  to adverse birth outcomes, little is known about the effects of exposure to specific constituents of  or mechanisms that contribute to these outcomes.


OBJECTIVES
Our objective was to investigate effects of oxidative potential and  metal components from non-exhaust traffic emissions, such as brake and tire wear, on the risk of preterm birth (PTB) and term low birth weight (TLBW).


METHODS
For a birth cohort of 285,614 singletons born in Los Angeles County, California, in the period 2017-2019, we estimated speciated  exposures modeled from land use regression with cokriging, including brake and tire wear related metals (barium and zinc), black carbon, and three markers of oxidative potential (OP), including modeled reactive oxygen species based on measured iron and copper (ROS), OH formation (), and dithiothreitol (DTT) loss (). Using logistic regression, we estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for PTB and TLBW with speciated  exposures and  mass as continuous variables scaled by their interquartile range (IQR).


RESULTS
For both metals and oxidative potential metrics, we estimated increased risks for PTB (ORs ranging from 1.01 to 1.03) and TLBW (ORs ranging from 1.02 to 1.05) per IQR exposure increment that were robust to adjustment for  mass. Associations for  mass, black carbon, metal components, and oxidative potential (especially ROS and ) with adverse birth outcomes were stronger in Hispanic, Black, and mixed-race or Native American women.


DISCUSSION
Our results indicate that exposure to  metals from brake and tire wear and particle components that contribute to oxidative potential were associated with an increased risk of PTB and TLBW in Los Angeles County, particularly among Hispanic, Black, and mixed-race or Native American women. Thus, reduction of  mass only may not be sufficient to protect the most vulnerable pregnant women and children from adverse effects due to traffic source exposures. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12196.",10.1289/EHP12196
"Microtoxic products such as those containing Carbazole were generated during DCF degradation with Ozone, UVA and UVC",Carbazole,Ozone,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Unravelling hidden threats of water disinfection: Toxicity evaluation and toxic products identification during diclofenac degradation.,"Diclofenac (DCF) is a widely-used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is routinely found in surface water bodies. While ozonation and ultraviolet (UV) radiation are commonly employed as disinfection methods in water treatment processes, the degradation of DCF in these processes occurs due to the strong oxidizing activity of the reactive oxygen species produced during both ozonation and UV radiation. Despite extensive studies reporting the removal and transformation of DCF through ozone and UV treatments, the potential hidden hazards of toxicity arising from these processes as well as the identification of the toxic transformation products have often been overlooked. In this study, various toxicities including microtoxicity, genotoxicity and antiestrogenicity were evaluated using multiple in-vitro bioassays. The transformation products were identified via ultra-performance liquid chromatography equipped with mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Correlation analysis was employed to gain deeper insight into the contributions of degradation products to overall toxicity. The results revealed that DCF possessed significant genotoxic and antiestrogenic effects, but displayed minimal microtoxicity. Microtoxic products such as those containing carbazole were generated during DCF degradation with ozone, UVA and UVC. Antiestrogenic products with dichloroaniline structures were observed in DCF ozonation but not in photodegradation by UVA and UVC. These findings highlighted the hidden risks associated with the disinfection of water containing micropollutants such as DCF.",10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123424

Different preparation methods resulted in different particle sizes and encapsulation efficiencies; the two aforementioned preparation processes generated dual-loaded liposomes with comparable physicochemical properties. The sequential encapsulation technique was selected for the subsequent research owing to its higher encapsulation efficiency prior to purification; the prepared Cyt/Daun liposomes had small and uniform particle size (108.6 ± 1.02 nm, Polydispersity index (PDI) 0.139 ± 0.01), negative charge (-(60.2 ± 1.15) mV), high drug encapsulation efficiency (Cyt 88.2 ± 0.24 %, Duan 94.2 ± 0.45 %) and good plasma stability.

The lyophilized liposomes were purple cakes, redissolved rapidly with insignificant alterations in particle size and encapsulation efficiency, and possessed well storage stability. The pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution studies demonstrated that the Cyt/Daun liposome could achieve long circulation and maintain synergic proportions of drugs within 24 h, increasing the accumulation of drugs at tumor sites.

Further, there are indications that the variation in expression of gut bacterial metabolic enzymes is less diverse than the taxonomic profile, underlying the importance of microbiome functionality, particularly from a toxicological perspective. To address these relationships, the gut bacterial composition of Wistar rats was altered by a 28 day oral treatment with the antibiotics tobramycin or colistin sulfate. On the basis of 16S marker gene sequencing data, tobramycin was found to cause a strong reduction in the diversity and relative abundance of the microbiome, whereas colistin sulfate had only a marginal impact. Associated plasma and fecal metabolomes were characterized by targeted mass spectrometry-based profiling. The fecal metabolome of tobramycin-treated animals had a high number of significant alterations in metabolite levels compared to controls, particularly in amino acids, lipids, bile acids (BAs), carbohydrates, and energy metabolites. The accumulation of primary BAs and significant reduction of secondary BAs in the feces indicated that the microbial alterations induced by tobramycin inhibit bacterial deconjugation reactions. The plasma metabolome showed less, but still many alterations in the same metabolite groups, including reductions in indole derivatives and hippuric acid, and furthermore, despite marginal effects of colistin sulfate treatment, there were nonetheless systemic alterations also in BAs. Aside from these treatment-based differences, we also uncovered interindividual differences particularly centering on the loss of Verrucomicrobiaceae in the microbiome, but with no apparent associated metabolite alterations. Finally, by comparing the data set from this study with metabolome alterations in the MetaMapTox database, key metabolite alterations were identified as plasma biomarkers indicative of altered gut microbiomes resulting from a wide activity spectrum of antibiotics.",10.1021/acs.chemrestox.2c00316

Optical labeling is one approach for tracing individual cells, but it typically requires genetic modification to induce the generation of photoconvertible proteins. Nevertheless, this approach has limitations and is not applicable to certain cell types. For instance, genetic modification often leads to the death of macrophages. This study aims to develop an alternative method for labeling macrophages by utilizing photoconvertible micron-sized capsules capable of easy internalization and prolonged retention within cells. Thermal treatment in a polyvinyl alcohol gel medium is employed for the scalable synthesis of capsules with a wide range of fluorescent dyes, including rhodamine 6G, pyronin B, fluorescein, acridine yellow, acridine orange, thiazine red, and previously reported rhodamine B. The fluorescence brightness, photostability, and photoconversion ability of the capsules are evaluated using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Viability, uptake, mobility, and photoconversion studies are conducted on RAW 264.7 and bone marrow-derived macrophages, serving as model cell lines. The production yield of the capsules is increased due to the use of polyvinyl alcohol gel, eliminating the need for conventional filtration steps. Capsules entrapping rhodamine B and rhodamine 6G meet all requirements for intracellular use in individual cell tracking. Mass spectrometry analysis reveals a sequence of deethylation steps that result in blue shifts in the dye spectra upon irradiation. Cellular studies on macrophages demonstrate robust uptake of the capsules. The capsules exhibit minimal cytotoxicity and have a negligible impact on cell motility. The successful photoconversion of RhB-containing capsules within cells highlights their potential as alternatives to photoconvertible proteins for individual cell labeling, with promising applications in personalized medicine.",10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e30680

Aviation, heavy transport, and the production of steel, cement, and chemicals are heavily dependent on carbon-containing fuels and feedstocks. A hopeful avenue toward carbon neutrality is the implementation of renewable carbon for the synthesis of critical fuels, chemicals, and materials. Biomass provides an opportune source of renewable carbon, naturally capturing atmospheric CO2 and forming multicarbon linkages and useful chemical functional groups. The constituent molecules nonetheless require various chemical transformations, often best facilitated by catalytic nanomaterials, in order to access usable final products.Catalyzed transformations of renewable biomass compounds may intersect with renewable energy production by offering a means to utilize excess intermittent electricity and store it within chemical bonds. Electrochemical catalytic processes can often offer advantages in energy efficiency, product selectivity, and modular scalability compared to thermal-driven reactions. Electrocatalytic reactions with renewable carbon feedstocks can further enable related processes such as water splitting, where value-adding organic oxidation reactions may replace the evolution of oxygen. Organic electroreduction reactions may also allow desirable hydrogenations of bonds without intermediate formation of H2 and need for additional reactors.This Account highlights recent work aimed at gaining a fundamental understanding of transformations involving biomass-derived molecules in electrocatalytic nanomaterials.

High-fat feeding increased the size of adipocytes isolated from retroperitoneal (RP) adipose tissue, while arginine treatment reduced their size. The total number of adipocytes in the adipose tissue did not differ among the four groups of rats. Glucose oxidation in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle, soleus muscle, and RP adipose tissue were reduced in response to high-fat feeding. On the contrary, oleic acid oxidation in RP adipose tissue was enhanced in rats fed the high-fat diet. Arginine treatment stimulated both glucose and oleic acid oxidation in EDL and soleus muscles, while having no effect on glucose oxidation, oleic acid oxidation, or basal lipolysis per 106 adipocytes in RP adipose tissue.

Hämet-Ahti).,"INTRODUCTION
A complex study of the antioxidant system enzymes (AOS) is an important subject of biochemical research; changes in the activity of these enzymes can be used as a biochemical marker of various processes in plants. At the same time, practically little attention has been paid to describing the regularities of these enzymatic reactions in different wood formation processes, such as xylogenesis. This article discusses the outcomes of different behaviors of AOS enzymes, which are involved in both the redistribution of the ROS balance and phenolic compounds at the early stages of wood formation in young plants of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) with straight-grained wood and Karelian birch (Betula pendula Roth var. carelica (Merckl.) Hamet-Ahti) with non-figured and figured parts within the single trunk.


BACKGROUND
Spectrophotometric determination of AOS enzymes' activity can be used as a biochemical marker in the different wood formation processes, including xylogenesis. In this study, we studied structural anomalies of the woody plant trunk of Karelian birch (Betula pendula Roth var. carelica (Merckl.) Hamet- Ahti).


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to study AOS enzymes' activity in 12-year-old plants of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) with straight-grained wood and Karelian birch (Betula pendula Roth var. carelica (Merckl.) Hamet-Ahti) with non-figured and figured parts within the single trunk.


METHODS
Plant tissues were ground in liquid nitrogen to a uniform mass and homogenized at 4°C in the buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 3 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM PMSF. After 20 min extraction, the homogenate was centrifuged at 10000 g for 20 min (MPW-351R, Poland). The sediment was washed in the buffer thrice. The pooled supernatant and sediment were dialyzed at 4°C for 18-20 h against a tenfold diluted homogenization buffer. The enzymes' activity was determined spectrophotometrically (Spectrophotometer SF-2000, OKB Spectr, Russia). Proteins in the extracts were quantified by the method of Bradford.


RESULTS
We observed different behaviors of the studied enzymes involved in both the redistribution of the ROS balance and phenolic compounds with subsequent lignification even at the early stages of wood formation in young plants and even in different trunk parts within a tree, which was consistent with results obtained earlier on adult plants. High SOD activity in the phloem compared to the activity in the xylem was accompanied by higher CAT activity. The POD/SOD ratio was significantly higher in the figured trunk parts in Karelian birch compared to other variants in the xylem and higher in Karelian birch plants compared to plants of common birch in the phloem. The CAT/POD ratio was significantly higher in plants with no signs of anomalies. The high POD and PPO activity in the xylem of figured trunk parts and in the phloem of figured and non-figured trunk parts of B. pendula var. carelica can be associated with the high activity of apoplast invertase.


CONCLUSION
The study showed that at the stage of active formation of structural anomalies in the figured trunk parts in young plants of Karelian birch, hydrogen peroxide utilization occurred mainly due to increased POD activity. An increase in PPO activity in the trunk of figured plants could also be considered an indicator of the formation of structural anomalies. At the same time, in areas with developing abnormal wood, the POD/SOD ratio increased, and the CAT/POD ratio decreased, indicating a fine-tuning of the balance between superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide, which, when changed, might regulate the rearrangement of xylogenesis towards proliferation in relation to differentiation.",10.2174/0929866530666230228113430

The antioxidant activity of the compound was determined using DPPH, hydrogen radical scavenging activity and reducing power assays, whereas antimicrobial activity was assessed using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method. Subjection of the DCM extract to column chromatography resulted in the isolation of a compound elucidated as olean-12-en-28-butanol-1-one, 3-hydroxy-4,4,10, 14, 20-pentamethyl (D4). Both the DPPH, H2O2 radical scavenging activity and reducing power assays revealed a significant antioxidant potential of compound D4 with an IC50 of 0.701 mg/mL, lower than that of gallic acid (0.793 mg/mL) for the H2O2 radical scavenging assay. The results also indicated good antibacterial activity of D4 with an IC50 of 0.25 mg/mL, compared to ciprofloxacin with an IC50 of 0.0039 mg/mL, against two Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli) and three Gram-positive (Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria.

Probiotics comprise effective feed additives that can replace antibiotics in animal livestock production. However, mono-strain probiotics appear less effective because of their instability. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate dietary supplementation with compound probiotics (CPP) on growth performance, diarrhea rate and intestinal mucosal barrier, as well as the possible molecular mechanism, in chicks. In total, 360 1-day-old chicks of the Hy-Line Brown Chicks were randomly divided into the control group (CON, basal diet), chlortetracycline group (500 mg kg-1 CTC) and compound probiotics group (1000 mg kg-1 CPP, consisting of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Enterococcus faecium and yeast). The experiment period was 56 days.


RESULTS
The results showed that, in comparison with the CON group, CPP significantly increased the average daily feed intake and average daily gain of chicks and reduced diarrhea (P < 0.05). The probiotic group exhibited increased immune organ (i.e. spleen and thymus) mass and increased levels of serum immunoglobulin (Ig)A, IgM and IgG (P < 0.05) compared to the CTC group. In addition, the jejunal mass and morphology were improved in the probiotic group (P < 0.05). Moreover, CPP reinforced jejunal barrier function, as indicated by increased transepithelial electrical resistance, protein expression of occludin and claudin-1, and diamine oxidase levels in the jejunum (P < 0.05). Likewise, enhanced fluorescence signals of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-labeled mitotic cells and villin-labeled absorptive cells in the jejunum (P < 0.05) suggested that CPP promoted intestinal stem cells activity. Mechanistically, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, including β-catenin, TCF4, c-Myc, cyclin D1 and Lgr5, was amplified in the jejunum by CPP addition (P < 0.05).


CONCLUSION
The present study demonstrated that dietary supplementation with CPP reinforced the jejunal epithelial integrity by activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling and enhanced immune function in chicks. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.",10.1002/jsfa.12562

However, the true potential of microbial synthesis of SMs has not been fully elucidated as the SM gene clusters remain silent under laboratory culture conditions. Herein, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of Staphylococcus aureus by co-culture of Eurotium amstelodami and three Bacillus species, including Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. In addition, a non-target approach based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF-MS) was used to detect differences in extracellular and intracellular metabolites. Notably, the co-culture of E. amstelodami and Bacillus spices significantly improved the inhibitory effect against S. aureus, with the combination of E. amstelodami and B. licheniformis showing best performance. Metabolomics data further revealed that the abundant SMs, such as Nummularine B, Lucidenic acid E2, Elatoside G, Aspergillic acid, 4-Hydroxycyclohexylcarboxylic acid, Copaene, and Pipecolic acid were significantly enhanced in co-culture. Intracellularly, the differential metabolites were involved in the metabolism of amino acids, nucleic acids, and glycerophospholipid.

"When Thiamine from supplementation (single- or multivitamin) was included, there appeared to be no difference in Thiamine intake between groups",Thiamine,difference in Thiamine,Component-Whole,component-whole,Low thiamine status in adults following low-carbohydrate / ketogenic diets: a cross-sectional comparative study of micronutrient intake and status.,"BACKGROUND
Low-carbohydrate diets (LCD) are popular for weight loss but lack evidence about micronutrient sufficiency in real-life use. This study assessed the intake and biochemical status of selected micronutrients in people voluntarily following LCDs.


METHODS
A cross-sectional study was conducted (2018-20) among 98 adults recruited as self-reporting either LCD (n = 49) or diets not restricting carbohydrates (controls; n = 49). Diets were assessed using the 130-item EPIC-Norfolk food-frequency questionnaire. Red-blood-cell thiamine diphosphate (TDP) was measured for thiamine status using HPLC. Plasma magnesium, zinc, copper, and selenium were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Between-group biomarker comparisons were conducted using ANCOVA and adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and diabetes status.


RESULTS
LCD-followers (26% male, median age 36 years, median BMI 24.2 kg/m2) reported adhering to LCDs for a median duration of 9 months (IQR 4-36). The most followed LCD type was 'their own variations of LCD' (30%), followed by ketogenic (23%), 'palaeolithic' (15%), and Atkins diets (8%). Among controls, 41% were male (median age 27 years, median BMI 23 kg/m2). Median macronutrient intakes for LCD vs control groups were carbohydrate 16%Energy (E) vs. 50%E; protein 25%E vs. 19%E; and fat 55%E vs 34%E (saturated fat 18%E vs. 11%E). Two-thirds of LCD followers (32/49) and half of the controls (24/49) reported some use of dietary supplements (p = 0.19). Among LCD-followers, assessing from food data only, 21 (43%) failed to meet the reference nutrient intake (RNI) for thiamine (vs.14% controls, p = 0.002). When thiamine from supplementation (single- or multivitamin) was included, there appeared to be no difference in thiamine intake between groups. Still, red-blood-cell TDP was lower in LCD-followers than controls (407 ± 91 vs. 633 ± 234 ng/gHb, p < 0.001). Three LCD-followers were thiamine-deficient (RBC thiamine < 275 ng/gHb) vs. one control. There were no significant differences in dietary intakes or plasma concentrations of magnesium, zinc, copper, and selenium between groups.


CONCLUSIONS
Following LCDs is associated with lower thiamine intake and TDP status than diets without carbohydrate restriction, incompletely corrected by supplement use. These data, coupled with a lack of RCT evidence on body weight control, do not support recommending LCDs for weight management without appropriate guidance and diet supplementation.",10.1007/s00394-024-03459-y

As the public interest in healthcare increases, illegal dietary supplements, foods, and drugs containing unauthorized pharmaceutical ingredients, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen, have been identified. Excessive and unintentional consumption is toxic to the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and liver; therefore, these pharmaceuticals must be monitored using analytical methods.


METHODS
A rapid and reliable analysis system involving liquid chromatography-quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry (LC-Q-Orbitrap/MS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) was established and validated to identify and quantify 30 NSAIDs and acetaminophen. In addition, we obtained the MS2 spectrum for each component with the proposed structure of the fragment ions.


RESULTS
The analytical method was applied to 505 samples of illicitly distributed dietary supplements, foods, and pharmaceuticals. Non-steroidal analgesics were detected in 126 samples. Carbamazepine (42.9%) and diclofenac (30.2%) were the most detected components in the samples; other pharmaceutical adulterants were also detected in some cases. Additionally, we present the identification of an unknown component, dexamethasone (799 μg/g), using LC-Q-Orbitrap/MS in a sample containing the unknown component with meloxicam (15.4 mg/g).


CONCLUSIONS
The developed analysis system, consisting of qualitative analysis using LC-Q-Orbitrap/MS and quantitative analysis using LC/MS/MS, can rapidly and accurately identify and quantify NSAIDs and acetaminophen while also identifying non-analytical components.",10.1002/rcm.9462
"Copper (Cu)-doped graphitic nanoplatelets (CuGnPs), one option to overcome this challenge, are made via a mechanochemical reaction between solid Graphite and Cu powder",Copper,Graphite,Component-Whole,component-whole,Characterization of Antimicrobial Properties of Copper-Doped Graphitic Nanoplatelets.,"Recent clinical outbreaks of infectious diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms, such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi, along with the emergence of unwanted microorganisms in industrial settings, have significantly reduced efficiency. Graphene has recently attracted significant attention as a potential antimicrobial agent because of its low toxicity, ease of production and functionalization, and high solubility in water. The presence of oxygen functional groups allows the interaction of the compound with bacteria and other biomolecules, making it an interesting candidate for antimicrobial therapy. Moreover, integrating graphene into copper coatings has been shown to enhance their antimicrobial properties. However, the implementation of copper-graphene composite coatings is currently limited by the difficulty of uniformly distributing graphene within the copper matrix. Copper (Cu)-doped graphitic nanoplatelets (CuGnPs), one option to overcome this challenge, are made via a mechanochemical reaction between solid graphite and Cu powder. The configuration of C-Cu bonds within CuGnPs can be identified using a range of analytical techniques, including transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. To evaluate the antibacterial activity of the Cu-GnPs, we employed Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus. Various amounts (250, 500, 750, and 1000 μg/mL) of prepared CuGnP samples were incubated in a bacterial suspension for 3 or 6 h at 150 rpm and 37 °C for a colony-forming unit assay. Three hours and six hours of treatment of the bacteria with CuGnPs led to a significant difference in bacterial survival compared with that of the control. It was observed that CuGnPs, with copper bound to graphene oxide, more effectively inhibited the proliferation of E. coli compared with nanoplatelets containing graphene oxide alone. These findings suggest that the unique properties of CuGnPs, such as C-Cu bonds, high surface area, and the coexistence of micropores and mesopores, are valuable for exerting strong antimicrobial effects making CuGnPs effective at preventing bacterial colonization on industrial surfaces.",10.3390/ijms252212414

Fluxes' prediction accuracy greatly relates to the deepness of the MM curation for a specific organism starting from the cell composition. One component is the cell wall, which is a functional barrier (cell shape, exchanges) with the environment. The bacterial cell wall (BCW), including its thickness, structure, and composition, has been extensively studied in Escherichia coli but poorly described for other organisms. The peptidoglycan (PG) layer composing the BCW is usually thinner in Gram- bacteria than in Gram+ bacteria. In both bacteria groups, PG is a polymeric mesh-like structure of amino acids and sugars, including N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylmuramic acid, and amino acids. In this study, we propose a high-throughput method to characterise and quantify PG in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria using acidic hydrolysis and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS). The method showed a relatively short time frame (11 min analytical run), low inter- and intraday variability (3.2% and 4%, respectively), and high sensitivity and selectivity (limits of quantification in the sub mg/L range). The method was successfully applied on two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli K12 MG1655, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron DSM 2079) and one Gram-positive bacterium (Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus DSM20259).

Fluxes' prediction accuracy greatly relates to the deepness of the MM curation for a specific organism starting from the cell composition. One component is the cell wall, which is a functional barrier (cell shape, exchanges) with the environment. The bacterial cell wall (BCW), including its thickness, structure, and composition, has been extensively studied in Escherichia coli but poorly described for other organisms. The peptidoglycan (PG) layer composing the BCW is usually thinner in Gram- bacteria than in Gram+ bacteria. In both bacteria groups, PG is a polymeric mesh-like structure of amino acids and sugars, including N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylmuramic acid, and amino acids. In this study, we propose a high-throughput method to characterise and quantify PG in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria using acidic hydrolysis and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS). The method showed a relatively short time frame (11 min analytical run), low inter- and intraday variability (3.2% and 4%, respectively), and high sensitivity and selectivity (limits of quantification in the sub mg/L range). The method was successfully applied on two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli K12 MG1655, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron DSM 2079) and one Gram-positive bacterium (Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus DSM20259).

Electrochemical adsorption has emerged as a feasible, rapid, and scalable method to treat contaminated water sources. However, graphene and its derivatives have limitations in ion adsorption via physisorption, forming a double layer that restricts the electrode's adsorption capacity. To address this, we propose the use of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with its extensive intercalation galleries of MoS2 nanosheets for cesium removal via an electrochemical route. Liquid-phase exfoliation with water and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) was then used to produce MoS2 nanosheets in a scalable quantity (high-yield production). The formation of a mixed solvent possessing relatively equivalent surface energy for exfoliation enabled us to achieve a remarkable exfoliation yield of up to ca. 1.26 mg mL-1, which is one of the highest yields reported to date (without a surfactant being added) and to the best of our knowledge. The 35% v/v of water in NMP displayed a maximum yield while maintaining the structure of the as-exfoliated one. Water exceeding over 66.7% v/v led to the formation of MoO3. Moreover, an insight into the cesium ion removal mechanism through the electrochemical route was demonstrated. It is found that the Cs+ removal follows electrochemical intercalation rather than adsorption. This work aids the understanding of cesium intercalation coupled with a mass-scale production method, which should lead to more efficient and cost-effective removal of radionuclides from contaminated water sources, opening new research avenues in materials and environmental science.",10.1021/acs.inorgchem.3c01508

Mushrooms are widely favored for their culinary and medicinal value; however, the presence of potentially lethal toxins in some species poses a substantial challenge in ensuring their safe consumption. Therefore, the development of a robust and sensitive analytical method is necessary for accurately identifying the risks associated with mushroom consumption. The study of mushroom toxins, which are characterized by their diversity and substantial variations in chemical structures, present a considerable challenge for achieving precise and high-throughput analysis. To address this issue, the present study employed a robust approach combining a solid-phase extraction (SPE) purification technique with high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) to establish an analytical method for the detection and quantification of five amatoxins and two tryptamines (psilocybin and bufotenine) present in some mushrooms. Several optimization procedures were undertaken, including optimizing the chromatographic conditions, mass spectrometric parameters, and sample extraction and purification. The procedure involved the extraction of dry mushroom powder with methanol containing 0.3% formic acid, followed by purification using a strong cation exchange cartridge (SCX). The analytes were separated on a T3 chromatographic column (100 mm×2.1 mm, 1.8 μm) using mobile phases of acetonitrile and 5 mmol/L ammonium acetate solution containing 0.1% formic acid. The multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was employed for data acquisition. Amatoxins were quantified using matrix-matched standard calibration curves, whereas isotopic internal standards were used to quantify tryptamine. The results showed that all seven toxins exhibited good linearities (r2>0.99) within the optimized concentration range. The limits of detection (LODs) for bufotenine, psilocybin, and amatoxins were determined as 2.0, 5.0, and 10 μg/kg, respectively, while the limits of quantification (LOQs) were determined as 5.0, 10, and 20 μg/kg, respectively. The LOD and LOQ values further underscore the ability of the method to detect minute quantities of toxins, making it particularly well suited for screening food samples for potential contamination. Using dried shiitake mushroom powder as the matrix, the recoveries of the two tryptamines ranged from 80.6% to 117%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs) ranging from 1.73% to 5.98%, while the recoveries of amatoxins ranged from 71.8% to 115%, with RSDs varying from 2.14% to 9.92% at the three concentration levels. The consistent and satisfactory recoveries of amatoxins and tryptamines demonstrated the ability of this method to accurately quantify the target analytes even in a complex matrix. Comparison with the results of supplementary test method recognized by State Administration for Market Regulation for food (BJS 202008) demonstrated comparable results, indicating no significant differences (p>0.05) in amatoxin contents. The newly developed method is rapid, accurate, precise, meets the required standards, and is suitable for the detection of seven toxins in wild mushrooms. As part of the application of this method, a comprehensive investigation of the distribution of toxins in wild mushrooms from Fujian Province was undertaken. In this study, 59 wild mushroom samples from nine cities were collected in the Fujian province. Species identification was conducted using rDNA-internal transcribed space (rDNA-ITS) molecular barcode technology, which revealed the presence of toxins in the two samples. Notably, one specimen named Amanita fuligineoides contained α-amanitin, β-amanitin, and phalloidin in quantities of 607, 377, and 69.0 mg/kg, respectively. Additionally, another sample, identified as Tricholomataceae, had a psilocybin concentration of 12.6 mg/kg.",10.3724/SP.J.1123.2023.07013

Current knowledge demonstrates the involvement of several transcription factors, effector proteins, and small RNAs in the Foc-banana interaction. However, the precise mode of communication at the interface remains elusive. Cutting-edge research has emphasized the significance of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in trafficking the virulent factors modulating the host physiology and defence system. EVs are ubiquitous inter- and intra-cellular communicators across kingdoms. This study focuses on the isolation and characterization of Foc EVs from methods that make use of sodium acetate, polyethylene glycol, ethyl acetate, and high-speed centrifugation. Isolated EVs were microscopically visualized using Nile red staining. Further, the EVs were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, which revealed the presence of spherical, double-membrane, vesicular structures ranging in size from 50 to 200 nm (diameter). The size was also determined using the principle based on Dynamic Light Scattering. The Foc EVs contained proteins that were separated using SDS-PAGE and ranged between 10 and 315 kDa. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of EV-specific marker proteins, toxic peptides, and effectors. The Foc EVs were found to be cytotoxic, whose toxicity increased with EVs isolated from the co-culture preparation. Taken together, a better understanding of Foc EVs and their cargo will aid in deciphering the molecular crosstalk between banana and Foc.",10.1016/j.bbagen.2023.130382

For a 15-week period, a total of 144 laying hens (19 weeks old) were randomly assigned to 8 dietary treatments, which were obtained by gradually replacing crude soybean oil with soybean acid oil (AO), or crude palm oil with palm fatty acid distillate (FAD). Thus, there were 4 soybean and 4 palm diets with 6% added fat varying in their FFA percentage (10%, 20%, 30%, and 45%), following a 2 × 4 factorial design. Each treatment included 6 replicates with 3 birds per replicate. Average daily feed intake and final body weight were significantly higher in palm diets (P < 0.001), while no differences were found in egg mass and feed conversion ratio. Higher levels of FFA in soybean diets resulted in lower egg production and higher egg weight (linear, P < 0.01). Regarding the degree of fat saturation, hens fed soybean diets presented higher digestibility of ether extract (EE), fatty acids, and calcium than palm diets (P < 0.001). The dietary FFA percentage negatively affected the digestibility of EE and calcium (P < 0.01), while having little effect on FA digestibility. There was a significant interaction in the AME; lower values were reported in soybean diets as the dietary FFA percentage increased (linear, P < 0.01), whereas palm diets remained unaffected. The experimental diets had little effect on gastrointestinal weight and length. However, the jejunum of soybean diets showed higher villus height and higher villus height-to-crypt depth ratio than palm diets (P < 0.05), and the dietary FFA percentage increased the crypt depth and decreased the villus height-to-crypt depth ratio (linear, P < 0.05). It was concluded that varying dietary FFA content did not affect fat utilization as much as the degree of saturation did, supporting the use of AO and FAD as alternative fat ingredients.",10.1016/j.aninu.2023.03.002

HClO is a safe and effective disinfectant and decomposing agent widely used as an alternative to sodium hypochlorite (NaClO). In this study, the authors aimed to evaluate the safety and efficiency of HClO generated by electrolyzing sodium chloride as a decontaminant. Cyclophosphamide (CPA), an antineoplastic drug, was selected as the model drug, and various solvents (HClO, NaClO, etc.) were compared to identify the solvents that could react with and efficiently decompose CPA. To identify a solvent that efficiently decomposes CPA, the CPA concentration was measured using liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection. When either NaClO or HClO was used, the CPA concentration decreased, and a peak corresponding to 3-chloro CPA, identified by mass spectrometry, was detected. Furthermore, to investigate the reversibility of the reaction between CPA and ClO-, ClO- was removed from the reaction solution using solid-phase extraction, resulting in the previously decreased CPA concentration returning to nearly its original level. Occupational exposure to antineoplastic drugs poses a significant risk to worker health. This study's results suggest that CPA can be replaced by 3-chloro CPA when HClO is used as the wiping solvent like NaClO, thereby reducing occupational exposure from wiping. Future studies should investigate the wiping and degradation efficiencies of other anti-cancer agents. Occupational exposure to anti-cancer drugs can be significantly reduced by integrating various mitigation measures, thereby contributing to a safer work environment for healthcare professionals.",10.1080/15459624.2024.2423752

Leaf Using Supercritical Fluid Chromatography-Medium Vacuum Chemical Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry.,"A method for the rapid determination of α-tocopherol (α-T) and its oxidative products in plant tissue has been developed using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) coupled with supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and medium vacuum chemical ionization (MVCI) with tandem mass spectrometry. The method is designed to study changes in levels for α-T and its oxidative products in plant cells during photosynthesis, aiming to observe the light response curves. α-T oxidation is a non-enzymatic self-defense mechanism in plant cells. Unlike enzyme-involved reactions, it cannot be stopped, so the oxidation continues in crude extracts even after extraction. Therefore, a real-time in-situ method is essential for tracking the light response curves. To optimize the selective reaction monitoring method, the reaction mixture of α-T and singlet oxygen (1O2), generated by rose Bengal under light illumination, was used as the source of oxidative products. The relative abundance changes in α-tocopherylquinone and 8a-hydroperoxy tocopherone in Pisum sativum L.

The performances of the POF-based biosensors in cortisol recognition are achieved using different functionalization protocols to make the same antibody receptor layer over the SPR surface via cysteamine and lipoic acid, achieving a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.8 pg/mL and 0.2 pg/mL, respectively. More specifically, the use of cysteamine or lipoic acid changes the distance between the receptor layer and the SPR surface, improving the sensitivity at low concentrations of about one order of magnitude in the configuration based on lipoic acid. The LODs of both cortisol biosensors are achieved well competitively with other sensor systems but without the need for amplification or sample treatments. In order to obtain the selectivity tests, cholesterol and testosterone were used as interfering substances. Moreover, tests in simulated seawater were performed for the same cortisol concentration range achieved in buffer solution to assess the immunosensor response to the complex matrix. Finally, the developed cortisol biosensor was used in a real seawater sample to estimate the cortisol concentration value. The gold standard method has confirmed the estimated cortisol concentration value in real seawater samples.

However, the transformation pathways of BrC chromophores, especially in the presence of photochemically active species, such as nitrate, are not well understood. In this study, the nitrate-mediated aqueous-phase photooxidation of three typical BrC chromophores from biomass burning was investigated, including 4-nitrocatechol, 3-nitrosalicylic acid, and 3,4-dinitrophenol. Variations in nitrate concentrations, pH, and temperatures were systematically examined to assess their impacts on the apparent photolysis rates of these BrC chromophores. The results show that increasing nitrate concentrations significantly enhances apparent photolysis rates to 3-3.5 times compared to nitrate-free conditions. Also, a temperature rise from 0 to 30 °C increases apparent photolysis rates by a factor of 1.3-2.5 for these chromophores. However, the effect of pH varies among these chromophores, depending on the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring. High-resolution mass spectrometric analysis suggests that the photooxidation of these chromophores initiates with the addition of nitro and/or hydroxyl groups to the benzene ring, followed by a ring-opening reaction and the formation of smaller, highly oxygenated molecules including formic acid, glyoxylic acid, malonic acid, and nitropropanoic acid. This study highlights the key role of nitrate in the aqueous-phase photooxidation of BrC, altering the aging pathways and shortening the atmospheric lifetimes of BrC. These results are of particular importance for a better understanding of BrC aging and its radiative forcing, given the increase of the nitrate mass fraction in aerosols of China in recent years.",10.1021/acs.est.4c06123

F1AP1 had a backbone of (1 → 4)-linked-D-galacturonic acid and (1 → 2)-linked-L-rhamnopyranosyl residues branched with arabinogalactan including multiple glycosidic linkages of T-α-Araf, 3-α-Araf, 5-α-Araf, T-α-Arap, 2-α-Arap, t-Galp, 2-Galp, 3-Galp, 4-Galp, 6-Galp, 2,4-Galp, 3,4-Galp, 3,6-Galp and 4,6-Galp side chains, having methyl and acetylated groups, and a high molecular weight (1945 kDa). The Mark-Houwink exponent was 0.276, indicating a compact spherical conformation. While the other F1AP6 fraction consists predominately of less methylated HG regions of pectin polysaccharides. The molar mass of this fraction was 117.5 kDa, which adopted a stiffer and random coil conformation. This knowledge allows us to evaluate how the balance of chemical structure and physical properties of the two pectin domains may manifest itself in the isolated structure of apricot pectin and its applications.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.135544
Healthy Oat seedlings (4 weeks old) were transplanted into plastic pots containing pasteurized potting mix infested with Millet seed-based inoculum of strain Y-Y-L F,Oat,Millet seed,Component-Whole,component-whole,Occurrence of Crown Rot Caused by Fusarium pseudograminearum in Oat (Avena sativa) in China.,"Oats (Avena sativa) are an important fodder crop for grazing livestock in northern and northwestern China (Chen et al. 2021; Yang et al. 2010). In May 2019, a crown rot disease was observed in a field where oat has been grown continuously for 5 years in Yongchang County (37.52° N, 101.16° E), Gansu Province, with an average disease incidence of 3%. Affected plants were stunted and displayed crown and basal stem rot. The basal stem showed chocolate brown discoloration and several basal stems appeared slightly constricted. Three disease plots were surveyed and at least 10 plants were collected from each plot. Infected basal stems were disinfested by immersion in 75% ethanol for 30 s and 1% NaClO for 2 min, rinsed three times in sterilized water. Then they were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium, incubated at 20°C in the dark. Isolates were purified by single spore cultures (Leslie and Summerell, 2006). Ten monosporic cultures were consistently isolated with similar phenotypes. Then those isolates were transferred onto carnation leaf agar (CLA) and incubated at 20°C under blacklight blue lamps. On PDA, isolates produced abundant aerial mycelium, densely floccose, reddish-white to white with deep-red to reddish-white reverse pigmentation. On CLA, macroconidia of the strains were formed in sporodochia, but no microconidia were found. Macroconidia (n=50) were relatively slender, curved to almost straight, commonly 3-7 septate, 22.2 to 43.7 × 3.0 to 4.8 μm (averag 28.5 × 3.9 μm). The morphological characteristics of this fungus fully fit the description of Fusarium species (Aoki and O'Donnell, 1999). For molecular identification, total genomic DNA of representative strain Y-Y-L was extracted by using an HP Fungal DNA Kit (D3195), and the elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1-α) gene and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2) gene were amplified using primers EF1 and EF2 (O'Donnell et al. 1998) and RPB2-5f2 and RPB2-7cr (O'Donnell et al. 2010), respectively. The sequences were deposited in GenBank (Accession numbers: OP113831 for EF1-α and OP113828 for RPB2). A nucleotide BLAST search revealed RPB2 and EF1-α sequences to be 99.78% and 100% similar to the corresponding sequences of the ex-type strain NRRL 28062 Fusarium pseudograminearum accessions numbers MW233433 and MW233090, respectively. In the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree, three Chinese strains (Y-Y-L, C-F-2 and Y-F-3) were grouped with the reference sequences of F. pseudograminearum with a high bootstrap supporting values of 98%. For pathogenicity tests, millet seed-based inoculum of F. pseudograminearum was prepared using a modified procedure (Chen et al. 2021). Healthy oat seedlings (4 weeks old) were transplanted into plastic pots containing pasteurized potting mix infested with millet seed-based inoculum of strain Y-Y-L F. pseudograminearum at a rate of 2% by mass fraction. Control seedlings for comparison were transplanted into pots containing potting mix without inoculum. Each treatment was inoculated with 5 pots each, with 3 plants per pot. Plants were maintained for 20 days under greenhouse conditions at 17 to 25℃ with all the inoculated plants developing symptoms similar to those observed in the field, while control plants remained healthy. The fungus was re-isolated from the basal stems of inoculated plants, and confirmed phenotypically and molecularly as F. pseudograminearum. F. pseudograminearum has been reported associated with crown rot in oat in Tunisia (Chekali et al. 2019). To our knowledge, this is the first report of F. pseudograminearum causing crown rot in oat in China. This study provides a basis for identifying pathogens causing oat root rot and managing the disease.",10.1094/PDIS-08-22-1885-PDN

During the entire observation period, the averaged fine particulate SOA was 7.9 ± 2.3 μg m-3, with precursor concentrations of 31 ± 11 ppbv for the measured volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and 16 ± 12 ppbv for NOx. Compared to those on the clean days, SOA on the haze days increased by a factor of 1.6, while the VOC and NOx increased by a factor of 1.3 and 2.0, respectively. Aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs, including acetaldehyde, formic acid, acetone, acetic acid, methyl ethyl ketone, and methylglyoxal) relationships suggested that the gasSOA and aqSOA occurred simultaneously on Chongming Island in winter. The gasSOA was primarily formed by the oxidation of aromatics and NOx at low RH (RH < 80%) conditions. In contrast, the aqSOA was formed under higher RH (RH > 80%) conditions via a combination of daytime photochemical aqueous phase processes of water-soluble OVOCs and nocturnal dark aqueous phase processes of primary emissions from biomass. The inversed higher mass ratio of NACs to (benzene + toluene) and nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR) in the daytime during the gasSOA-dominated haze periods indicated that gasSOA could be transformed to aqSOA at high NOx levels. Our results also suggested the importance of NOx and VOC reduction measures in directly mitigating gasSOA and indirectly mitigating aqSOA during winter haze pollution.",10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120684

In addition to plasticized starch (28.8% w/w), the compositions made also contained other ingredients, such as polyethylene-graft-maleic anhydride as a compatibilizer, ethylene propylene terpolymer elastomer, cross-linking agents, and nanoclay. Plasticized starch contains 68.6% w/w potato starch, 29.4% w/w glycerin, and 2% w/w anhydrous citric acid. Blends based on HDPE and plasticized starch were made in a Brabender Plasti-Corder internal mixer at 160 °C, and plates for testing were obtained using the compression method. Thermal analyses indicate an increase in the crystallization degree of the HDPE after the addition of plasticized starch. SEM micrographs indicate that blends are compatibilized, with the plasticized starch being well dispersed as droplets in the HDPE matrix. Samples show high hardness values (62-65° ShD), good tensile strength values (14.88-17.02 N/mm2), and Charpy impact strength values (1.08-2.27 kJ/m2 on notched samples, and 7.96-20.29 kJ/m2 on unnotched samples). After 72 h of water immersion at room temperature, mixtures containing a compatibilizer had a mass variation below 1% and water absorption values below 1.7%. Upon increasing the water immersion temperature to 80 °C, the sample without the compatibilizer showed a mass reduction of -2.23%, indicating the dissolution of the plasticized starch in the water. The samples containing the compatibilizer had a mass variation of max 8.33% and a water absorption of max 5.02%. After toluene immersion for 72 h at room temperature, mass variation was below 8%.",10.3390/polym16213051
"In conclusion, our results suggested that the active packaging system based on OPP/Gelatin bilayer film was more suitable for raw lamb preservation than single-layer gelatin film or petroleum-derived plastic film, but need further study, including minimizing the amount of essential oil, enhancing the mechanical strength of the gelatin film after Water absorption.",Gelatin,Water,Component-Whole,component-whole,Development of Plastic/Gelatin Bilayer Active Packaging Film with Antibacterial and Water-Absorbing Functions for Lamb Preservation.,"In order to extend the shelf life of refrigerating raw lamb by inhibiting the growth of microorganisms, preventing the oxidation of fat and protein, and absorbing the juice outflow of lamb during storage, an active packaging system based on plastic/gelatin bilayer film with essential oil was developed in this study. Three kinds of petroleum-derived plastic films, oriented polypropylene (OPP), polyethylene terephthalate, and polyethylene, were coated with gelatin to make bilayer films for lamb preservation. The results showed significant improvement in the mechanical properties, oxygen, moisture, and light barriers of the bilayer films compared to the gelatin film. The OPP/gelatin bilayer film was selected for further experiments because of its highest acceptance by panelists. If the amount of juice outflow was less than 350% of the mass of the gelatin layer, it was difficult for the gelatin film to separate from lamb. With the increase in essential oil concentration, the water absorption capacity decreased. The OPP/gelatin bilayer films with 20% mustard or 10% oregano essential oils inhibited the growth of bacteria in lamb and displayed better mechanical properties. Essential oil decreased the brightness and light transmittance of the bilayer films and made the film yellow. In conclusion, our results suggested that the active packaging system based on OPP/gelatin bilayer film was more suitable for raw lamb preservation than single-layer gelatin film or petroleum-derived plastic film, but need further study, including minimizing the amount of essential oil, enhancing the mechanical strength of the gelatin film after water absorption.",10.5851/kosfa.2023.e32

To date, little is known about this enzyme in terms of genetic information, structure, properties and virulence mechanism due to the difficulties in purification caused by its low secretion amount, high specific activity, uncompleted genome sequencing and annotation. This work investigated the gene, structure and enzymatic properties of this enzyme. The S. aurantiacum elastase-like protease from the fungal culture supernatant was analyzed through tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) approach, illustrating its primary structure. Bioinformatics tools were employed to predict the conserved domain and tertiary structure, the enzymatic properties were also studied. It turned out that S. aurantiacum extracellular elastase-like protease demonstrated well hydrolysis towards elastin and bovine achilles tendon collagen, with Vmax of 18.14 μg/s and 17.57 μg/s respectively, better than fish scale gelatin, with the lowest hydrolysis effect on casein. Its activity towards elastin was lower than that of the elastase from porcine pancreas, with values of Kcat/Km of 3.541 (μg/s) and 4.091 (μg/s), respectively. It was an alkaline protease, with optimal pH 8.2 and temperature 37 oC. Zn2+ promoted the enzymatic activity while Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, elastatinal and PMSF inhibited its activity. Its sequence was similar to Paecilomyces lilacinus secreted serine protease (PDB Entry: c3f7oB_) with multiple conserved fractions each containing more than 7 amino acids, thus suitable for design of PCR primer.

"In this study, sulfidated nano zero-valent iron-Copper (S-nZVIC) with low Cu doping and sulfidation was synthesized for PAA activation, resulting in more efficient degradation of Sulfamethoxazole (SMX, 20 μM) and other contaminants using a low dose of catalyst (0.05 g/L) and oxidant (100 μM)",Copper,Sulfamethoxazole,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Doped Cu0 and sulfidation induced transition from R-O• to •OH in peracetic acid activation by sulfidated nano zero-valent iron-copper.,"Peracetic acid (PAA) has emerged as a new effective oxidant for various contaminants degradation through advanced oxidation process (AOP). In this study, sulfidated nano zero-valent iron-copper (S-nZVIC) with low Cu doping and sulfidation was synthesized for PAA activation, resulting in more efficient degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX, 20 μM) and other contaminants using a low dose of catalyst (0.05 g/L) and oxidant (100 μM). The characterization results suggested that S-nZVIC presented a more uniform size and distribution with fewer metal oxides, as the agglomeration and oxidation were inhibited. More significantly, doped Cu0 and sulfidation significantly enhanced the generation and contribution of •OH but decreased that of R-O• in S-nZVIC/PAA/SMX system compared with that of nZVIC and S-nZVI, accounting for the relatively high degradation efficiency of 97.7% in S-nZVIC/PAA/SMX system compared with 85.7% and 78.9% in nZVIC/PAA/SMX and S-nZVI/PAA/SMX system, respectively. The mechanisms underlying these changes were that (i) doped Cu° could promote the regeneration of Fe(Ⅱ) for strengthened PAA activation through mediating Fe(Ⅱ)/Fe(Ⅲ) cycle by Cu(Ⅰ)/Cu(Ⅱ) cycle; (ii) S species might consume part of R-O•, resulting in a decreased contribution of R-O• in SMX degradation; (iii) sulfidation increased the electrical conductivity, thus facilitating the electron transfer from S-nZVIC to PAA. Consequently, the dominant reactive oxygen species transited from R-O• to •OH to degrade SMX more efficiently. The degradation pathways, intermediate products and toxicity were further analyzed through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and T.E.S.T software analysis, which proved the environmental friendliness of this process. In addition, S-nZVIC exhibited high stability, recyclability and degradation efficiency over a wide pH range (3.0∼9.0).

If not handled quickly and appropriately, these diseases can cause considerable losses to farmers. Therefore, it is necessary to find a solution with safe and environmentally friendly disease prevention technology using natural ingredients, among others from plants, namely oil palm. Some parts of oil palm, namely leaves, fronds, fibres and oil palm pulp, which are palm waste, contain antibacterial compounds. This study aimed to assess the antibacterial activity of palm waste extracts, namely pulp, leaves, fronds and fibres using n-hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, ethanol and water maceration solvents against pathogenic bacteria V. harveyi and V. parahaemolyticus, and identify active compounds contained in palm waste. The results of the research are expected to produce innovative and sustainable solutions to control diseases in shrimp farming, contribute to the development of a sustainable fishing industry and open up the potential for utilizing palm waste as a value-added resource in the field of aquatic health.

The research was conducted to calculate feed, calcium (Ca) intake, Ca requirements, and egg production for Arabic hens during the early egg-laying period.


Materials and Methods
A total of 135 30-week-old Silver female Arabic pullets were randomly allocated to one of three treatments with five replicate cages with a semi-scavenging system of nine pullets per cage in a completely randomized design and allowed to choose Ca from limestone and oyster shells. As a control (T1), pullets were only given a complete feed with Ca and phosphorus percentages according to Hy-line International in 2018. Other treatment feeds were control feed without limestone fed with a combination of limestone (T2) or oyster shell (T3) separately.


Results
The treatments had no effect (p > 0.05) on feed, grit and Ca intake (gm/bird/week), egg weight (gm), egg mass, egg production (%), and feed efficiency, but had an effect (p < 0.05) on Ca concentration (%). Ca concentration was the same at T1 and T3, and both were higher than at T2.


Conclusion
The female Arabic chickens could fulfill Ca requirements by selecting from different sources of Ca. Limestone is better than the oyster shell as a source of Ca. The Ca requirement for Arabic hens in the early laying period based on the Ca concentration of the feed intake is sufficient at around 3.64% since producing the same number of egg production and heavier egg weight compared to a higher Ca level.",10.5455/javar.2023.j649
"For spICP-TOFMS analysis of leaded IGSR particles, classification may be based on the presence of lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), and Barium (Ba) just as in SEM-EDS; however, additional particle types, such as lead-Copper (Pb-Cu) particles, contribute significantly (∼30%) to the leaded IGSR particle population",Barium,Copper,Cause-Effect,component-whole,Elemental Characterization of Leaded and Lead-Free Inorganic Primer Gunshot Residue Standards Using Single Particle Inductively Coupled Plasma Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry.,"This study describes the use of single particle inductively coupled plasma time-of-flight mass spectrometry (spICP-TOFMS) for the detection and classification of inorganic gunshot residue (IGSR) particles. To establish reliable multi-element criteria to classify IGSR particles, leaded and lead-free IGSR reference materials were analyzed, and the elemental compositions of the individual particles were quantified. The results suggest that expanded element compositions may be used to classify IGSR particles via spICP-TOFMS compared to those used in conventional IGSR analysis using scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). For spICP-TOFMS analysis of leaded IGSR particles, classification may be based on the presence of lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), and barium (Ba) just as in SEM-EDS; however, additional particle types, such as lead-copper (Pb-Cu) particles, contribute significantly (∼30%) to the leaded IGSR particle population. In lead-free IGSR particles, the dominate multi-metal particle composition found is titanium-zinc (Ti-Zn) with a conserved Zn:Ti ratio of 1.4:1, but other elements, such as copper (Cu), are also characteristic. In mixtures of the two IGSR reference materials, we were able to classify over 80% of the multi-metal particles detected with no false-positive particle-type assignments. With spICP-TOFMS, particles smaller than those typically measured by SEM-EDS are detected, with estimated median diameters for leaded and lead-free IGSR of 180 and 320 nm, respectively. Through measuring these smaller particles, up to ∼two times more particles per mL are recorded by spICP-TOFMS compared to that found by SEM-EDS. Overall, high-sensitivity and high-throughput analysis using spICP-TOFMS enables quantitative, rapid multi-elemental characterization, and classification of individual IGSR particles.",10.1177/00037028221142624
"Background: Honey is one of the most adulterated foods worldwide, and several analytical methods have been developed over the last decade to detect syrup additions to Honey",Honey,additions to Honey,Component-Whole,component-whole,Detection of Sugar Syrups in Honey Using Untargeted Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry and Chemometrics.,"Background: Honey is one of the most adulterated foods worldwide, and several analytical methods have been developed over the last decade to detect syrup additions to honey. These include approaches based on stable isotopes and the specific detection of individual marker compounds or foreign enzymes. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy is applied as a rapid and comprehensive screening method, which also enables the detection of quality parameters and the analysis of the geographical and botanical origin. However, especially for the detection of foreign sugars, 1H-NMR has insufficient sensitivity. Methods: Since untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is more sensitive, we used this approach for the detection of positive and negative ions in combination with a recently developed data processing workflow for routine laboratories based on bucketing and random forest for the detection of rice, beet and high-fructose corn syrup in honey. Results: We show that the distinction between pure and adulterated honey is possible for all three syrups, with classification accuracies ranging from 98 to 100%, while the accuracy of the syrup content estimation depends on the respective syrup. For rice and beet syrup, the deviations from the true proportion were in the single-digit percentage range, while for high-fructose corn syrup they were much higher, in some cases exceeding 20%. Conclusions: The approach presented here is very promising for the robust and sensitive detection of syrup in honey applied in routine laboratories.",10.3390/metabo14110633
"Free Amino acids (FAAs) are one of the important nutritional components of Honey, which can be used not only as a nutritional indicator of honey but also as an indicator of plant source identification",Amino acids,Honey,Component-Whole,component-whole,Analysis of Free Amino Acid Composition and Honey Plant Species in Seven Honey Species in China.,"Honey is well-known as a food product that is rich in active ingredients and is very popular among consumers. Free amino acids (FAAs) are one of the important nutritional components of honey, which can be used not only as a nutritional indicator of honey but also as an indicator of plant source identification. In this study, the contents of 20 FAAs in seven types of honey from 11 provinces in China were examined for the first time. The 20 FAAs were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). By analyzing 93 honey samples from seven types of honey, the FAAs were found to range from 394.4 mg/kg (linden honey) to 1771.7 mg/kg (chaste honey). Proline ranged from 274.55 to 572.48 mg/kg, and methionine was only present in some of the linden honey, chaste honey, acacia honey, and rape honey. Evaluated by amino acid principal component analysis, multifloral grassland honey had the highest overall evaluation score, acacia and jujube honey were the most similar, while chaste honey was the least similar to the other types of honey. In addition, DNA was extracted from 174 Xinjiang grassland honey samples and different plant leaves for PCR and sequencing to identify the species of nectar plants. As a result, 12 families and 25 species of honey plants were identified. The results confirmed the diversity of FAAs in dissimilar types and sources of honey. This study provides a reference for expanding honey quality standards and verifying the authenticity of honey.",10.3390/foods13071065

"Chemical fertilizers like Urea supply the necessary nutrients, including Nitrogen",Urea,Nitrogen,Component-Whole,component-whole,Acetylated lignin sulfonate as a biodegradable coating for controlled-release urea fertilizer: A novel acetylation method and diffusion coefficient analysis.,"Plants require essential nutrients to grow, which soil alone cannot provide. Chemical fertilizers like urea supply the necessary nutrients, including nitrogen. They quickly dissolve in water and can contaminate it with nitrate and nitrite, which can cause diseases. Slow-release fertilizers are a better option to reduce environmental risks. Researchers are exploring cheap and biodegradable alternatives, such as lignin. A critical discussion in the coated urea fertilizer is modeling the nitrogen diffusion process in the coating, which predicts the system's behavior. This article uses lignin sulfonate to coat urea fertilizer, which should first be acetylated with decanoyl chloride. One of the critical parameters is the diffusion coefficient (D). D is determined using the mass transfer flux and the completion time of the effective substance, and with its help, the graph of the total mass transferred from the membrane in a specific time (Mt) is determined. D equals 6.298813 × 10-8 cm2/s using the time lag method. Also, with the fixed-point convergence method, 5.8849 × 10-8 cm2/s was obtained, which has about 0.80 % error with the D obtained by the time lag method. The Mt obtained from the analytical method and the experimental data coincides with a minimal error, which indicates high accuracy.",10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.134190

"The presence of Cadmium, lead, nickel, Chromium, zinc, and mercury was also examined",Cadmium,Chromium,Cause-Effect,component-whole,Digestate from Agricultural Biogas Plants as a Reservoir of Antimicrobials and Antibiotic Resistance Genes-Implications for the Environment.,"Antimicrobials and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in substrates processed during anaerobic digestion in agricultural biogas plants (BPs) can reach the digestate (D), which is used as fertilizer. Antimicrobials and ARGs can be transferred to agricultural land, which increases their concentrations in the environment. The concentrations of 13 antibiotics in digestate samples from biogas plants (BPs) were investigated in this study. The abundance of ARGs encoding resistance to beta-lactams, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotics, and the integrase genes were determined in the analyzed samples. The presence of cadmium, lead, nickel, chromium, zinc, and mercury was also examined. Antimicrobials were not eliminated during anaerobic digestion. Their concentrations differed in digestates obtained from different substrates and in liquid and solid fractions (ranging from 62.8 ng/g clarithromycin in the solid fraction of sewage sludge digestate to 1555.9 ng/L doxycycline in the liquid fraction of cattle manure digestate). Digestates obtained from plant-based substrates were characterized by high concentrations of ARGs (ranging from 5.73 × 102 copies/gDcfxA to 2.98 × 109 copies/gDsul1). The samples also contained mercury (0.5 mg/kg dry mass (dm)) and zinc (830 mg/kg dm). The results confirmed that digestate is a reservoir of ARGs (5.73 × 102 to 8.89 × 1010 copies/gD) and heavy metals (HMs). In addition, high concentrations of integrase genes (105 to 107 copies/gD) in the samples indicate that mobile genetic elements may be involved in the spread of antibiotic resistance. The study suggested that the risk of soil contamination with antibiotics, HMs, and ARGs is high in farms where digestate is used as fertilizer.",10.3390/ijerph20032672

Specifically, the copper smelting process releases arsenic, a semi-volatile metalloid, which poses an emerging exposure risk to both workers and nearby residents. To comprehensively understand the internal exposure risks of metal(loid)s from copper smelting, we explored eighteen metal(loid)s and arsenic metabolites in the urine of both occupational and non-occupational populations using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry with high-performance liquid chromatography and compared their health risks. Results showed that zinc and copper (485.38 and 14.00 µg/L), and arsenic, lead, cadmium, vanadium, tin and antimony (46.80, 6.82, 2.17, 0.40, 0.44 and 0.23 µg/L, respectively) in workers (n=179) were significantly higher compared to controls (n=168), while Zinc, tin and antimony (412.10, 0.51 and 0.15 µg/L, respectively) of residents were significantly higher than controls. Additionally, workers had a higher monomethyl arsenic percentage (MMA%), showing lower arsenic methylation capacity. Source appointment analysis identified arsenic, lead, cadmium, antimony, tin and thallium as co-exposure metal(loid)s from copper smelting, positively relating to the age of workers. The hazard index (HI) of workers exceeded 1.0, while residents and control were approximately at 1.0. Besides, all three populations had accumulated cancer risks exceeding 1.0 × 10-4, and arsenite (AsIII) was the main contributor to the variation of workers and residents. Furthermore, residents living closer to the smelting plant had higher health risks.

For TMAH extraction, cysteine and CaCl2 were used to evaluate their stabilization effect on the silver forms. The analytical techniques single-particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SP-ICP-MS), hydrodynamic chromatography hyphenated to ICP-MS (HDC-ICP-MS) and asymmetric flow field flow fractionation coupled to ICP-MS (AF4-ICP-MS) were applied to the simultaneous detection of particulate and dissolved silver. Results have shown that water extraction was a suitable option to assess the environmental release of silver, with percentages of 3 and 9% for faeces of pigs and chickens, respectively. The use of TMAH extraction combined with SP-ICP-MS analysis was useful to characterize Ag-containing particles (less than 1%). Both stabilizers, cysteine and CaCl2, have a similar effect on silver nanoparticle preservation for chicken faeces, whereas cysteine-Triton was better for pig samples. In any case, silver extraction efficiency with TMAH was low (39-42%) for both types of faeces due to a matrix effect. TSPP followed by ICP-MS enabled the fractionation of the silver in the faeces, with silver sulphide (41%) and ionic silver (62%) being the most abundant fractions.",10.1007/s00604-023-05777-0

As the unique ingredient of cottonseed oil, gossypol is toxic and there are differences between the enantiomers. Although the determination of (-)- and (+)-gossypol in cotton plants or cottonseed was performed, the detection about the gossypol enantiomers in vegetable oil was rarely reported.


OBJECTIVE
To develop a specific inspection method for (-)- and (+)-gossypol in vegetable oil by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) -tandem mass spectrometry with chiral pre-column derivatization.


METHOD
(-)- and (+)-gossypol were separated on an ACQUITY C18 reverse phase column (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm) maintained at 40 °C on an UPLC system with gradient elution. The mobile phases was composed of methanol (solvent A) and water containing 0.1% formic acid (solvent B). Analytes were detected with Electron Spray Ionization source in the positive mode. The contents of (-)- and (+)-gossypol standard derivatives were quantified by Multiple Reaction Monitoring with the transitions of m/z 633/483 for quantitative ion pairs and m/z 633/558 for qualitative ion pairs.


RESULTS
The results indicated that the quantitative analysis could be accomplished within 12.5 minutes and the limits of detection of (-)- and (+)-gossypol were 25.55 μg/kg and 14.67 μg/kg, respectively. When this method was applied to olive oil spiked with gossypol standards, good recoveries (95.37%-105.84% for (-)-gossypol, 98.96%-105.14% for (+)-gossypol) and RSDs (3.41%-6.02% for (-)-gossypol, 4.50%-6.94% for (+)-gossypol) were achieved.


CONCLUSION
The present study confirms the feasibility of determining the gossypol enantiomers and achieves trace determination of (-)- and (+)-gossypol in vegetable oil. These results make this method more suitable for the qualitative identification of whether the vegetable oil has been mixed with cottonseed oil.

The total concentration of pesticides in the dry season samples ranged from 0.1 ng/L to 543.5 ng/L, with a median of 60.2 ng/L and a median average daily dose of 2.0 ng/(kg·d). Among the 498 samples, the maximum carcinogenic risk of dichlorvos was 2.0×10~(-7), and the maximum carcinogenic risk of trifluralin was 1.1×10~(-10). The non-carcinogenic HI of 19 pesticides and metabolites pesticides was ≤6.0×10~(-3). Among them, the maximum HI of the middle route of the South to North Water Diversion Project, the lower reaches of the Yellow River, the eastern route of the South to North Water Diversion Project, the Liaohe River, and the Songhua River basin was 2.0×10~(-3)-6.0×10~(-3), while the HI of other basins was less than 1.0×10~(-3).


CONCLUSION
Different concentrations of pesticides have been detected in raw water, finished water, and tap water of key river basins in China, with the highest total concentration of detected reaching 1299.4 ng/L. The carcinogenic risk was lower than 10~(-6) and the non-carcinogenic hazard index of 19 pesticides was less than 1, and both below the acceptable level. Because of the universality and diverse occurrence of these pesticides in drinking water, long-term exposure to pesticides is still a concern.",10.19813/j.cnki.weishengyanjiu.2024.05.007
The results indicated that the fermentation processing of Rice ingredients results in alterations to the Choline-containing compounds present in foods,Rice,Choline,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Determination of Choline-Containing Compounds in Rice Bran Fermented with Aspergillus oryzae Using Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry.,"Choline-containing compounds are essential nutrients for human activity, as they are involved in many biological processes, including cell membrane organization, methyl group donation, neurotransmission, signal transduction, lipid transport, and metabolism. These compounds are normally obtained from food. Fermented brown rice and rice bran with Aspergillus oryzae (FBRA) is a fermented food product derived from rice and rice ingredients. FBRA exhibits a multitude of functional properties with respect to the health sciences. This study has a particular focus on choline-containing compounds. We first developed a simultaneous liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis method for seven choline-containing compounds. The method was subsequently applied to FBRA and its ingredients. Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) and selected reaction monitoring were employed for the simultaneous analysis of seven choline-containing compounds. MS ion source conditions were optimized in positive ion mode, and the product ions derived from the choline group were obtained through MS/MS optimization. Under optimized HILIC conditions, the peaks exhibited good shape without peak tailing. Calibration curves demonstrated high linearity across a 300- to 10,000-fold concentration range. The application of the method to FBRA and other ingredients revealed significant differences between food with and without fermentation. In particular, betaine and α-glycerophosphocholine were found to be highest in FBRA and brown rice malt, respectively. The results indicated that the fermentation processing of rice ingredients results in alterations to the choline-containing compounds present in foods. The developed HILIC/MS/MS method proved to be a valuable tool for elucidating the composition of choline-containing compounds in foods.",10.5702/massspectrometry.A0151
"However, mature Rice seeds do not contain detectable levels of Sakuranetin",Rice,Sakuranetin,Component-Whole,component-whole,Biofortified Rice Provides Rich Sakuranetin in Endosperm.,"Sakuranetin plays a key role as a phytoalexin in plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and possesses diverse health-promoting benefits. However, mature rice seeds do not contain detectable levels of sakuranetin. In the present study, a transgenic rice plant was developed in which the promoter of an endosperm-specific glutelin gene OsGluD-1 drives the expression of a specific enzyme naringenin 7-O-methyltransferase (NOMT) for sakuranetin biosynthesis. The presence of naringenin, which serves as the biosynthetic precursor of sakuranetin made this modification feasible in theory. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) validated that the seeds of transgenic rice accumulated remarkable sakuranetin at the mature stage, and higher at the filling stage. In addition, the panicle blast resistance of transgenic rice was significantly higher than that of the wild type. Specially, the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) imaging was performed to detect the content and spatial distribution of sakuranetin and other nutritional metabolites in transgenic rice seeds. Notably, this genetic modification also did not change the nutritional and quality indicators such as soluble sugars, total amino acids, total flavonoids, amylose, total protein, and free amino acid content in rice. Meanwhile, the phenotypes of the transgenic plant during the whole growth and developmental periods and agricultural traits such as grain width, grain length, and 1000-grain weight exhibited no significant differences from the wild type. Collectively, the study provides a conceptual advance on cultivating sakuranetin-rich biofortified rice by metabolic engineering. This new breeding idea may not only enhance the disease resistance of cereal crop seeds but also improve the nutritional value of grains for human health benefits.",10.1186/s12284-024-00697-w
"On the other hand, Bacillus subtilis natto produces a Water-soluble complex, which comprises Menaquinone-7 and peptides",Water,Menaquinone,Component-Whole,component-whole,Characterization of K-binding factor involved in water-soluble complex of menaquinone-7 produced by Bacillus subtilis natto.,"Vitamin Ks are expected to contribute bone and cardiovascular health. Especially, menaquinone-7 has a higher bioavailability and a longer half-life than other vitamin Ks in the human body. However, their low water-solubility limits their application. On the other hand, Bacillus subtilis natto produces a water-soluble complex, which comprises menaquinone-7 and peptides. The peptide named K-binding factor (KBF) has been reported as the main component of the complex. In the present, the structural characteristics of KBF were studied. Mass spectrometry showed significant peaks at m/z = 1050, while the previous PAGE suggested that molecular weight of KBF was ~ 3k. Amino acid analysis revealed that the 1k peptides were the various combinations of nine amino acids, among which Asx, Glx, Val, Leu and Met were found to be the most abundant. The peptides could serve as detergent properties. The 1k peptides could be isolated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The bundle of three 1k detergent-like peptides would participate to the micelle structure containing menqauinone-7 inside. In conclusion, a basic unit of KBF would be the ~ 1k peptides, and the three basic unit assemble to the ~ 3k bundle, then the bundle form a water-soluble micelle including menqauinone-7 inside.",10.1093/jb/mvad051

Pomegranate extracts standardized to punicalagins are a rich source of ellagitannins including Ellagic acid (EA),Pomegranate,Ellagic acid,Component-Whole,component-whole,Development of a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for characterizing pomegranate extract pharmacokinetics in humans.,"Pomegranate extracts standardized to punicalagins are a rich source of ellagitannins including ellagic acid (EA). Recent evidence suggests that gut microbiota-derived urolithin (Uro) metabolites of ellagitannins are pharmacologically active. Studies have evaluated the pharmacokinetics of EA, however, little is known about the disposition of urolithin metabolites (urolithin A (UA) and B (UB)). To address this gap, we developed and applied a novel ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) assay for the characterization of EA and Uro oral pharmacokinetics in humans. Subjects (10/cohort) received a single oral dose (250 or 1000 mg) of pomegranate extract (Pomella® extract) standardized to contain not less than 30 % punicalagins, < 5 % EA, and not less than 50 % polyphenols. Plasma samples, collected over 48 h, were treated with β-glucuronidase and sulfatase to permit comparison between unconjugated and conjugated forms of EA, UA and UB. EA and urolithins were separated by gradient elution (acetonitrile/water, 0.1 % formic acid) using a C18 column connected to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in the negative mode. Conjugated EA exposure was ∼5-8-fold higher than unconjugated EA for both dose groups. Conjugated UA was readily detectable beginning ∼8 h post-dosing, however, unconjugated UA was detectable in only a few subjects. Neither form of UB was detected. Together these data indicate EA is rapidly absorbed and conjugated following oral administration of Pomella® extract. Moreover, UA's delayed appearance in the blood, primarily in the conjugated form, is consistent with gut microbiota-mediated metabolism of EA to UA, which is then rapidly converted to its conjugated form.",10.1016/j.jpba.2023.115477
"Experimental approach
In this study, two temperatures (40 and 60 °C) at a constant pressure during the extraction of anchovy by-products with supercritical CO2 fluid were used to determine extraction yield, fatty acid, Tocopherol and phytosterol composition, followed by microencapsulation with two matrices based on the transglutaminase-mediated crosslinking reaction between Whey protein isolates and casein",Tocopherol,Whey,Component-Whole,component-whole,Supercritical CO2 Fluid Extraction and Microencapsulation of Oil from Anchovy (Engraulis mordax) By-Products.,"Research background
Fish by-products are discarded as waste, which has a significant impact on the environment. They have no economic value, but there are many opportunities to turn them into high value products. Due to significant quantities generated internationally and the continuous expansion of the market for ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids as nutraceuticals, innovative technological approaches are needed to transform this waste into marketable products with added value, while limiting the risk of environmental pollution.


Experimental approach
In this study, two temperatures (40 and 60 °C) at a constant pressure during the extraction of anchovy by-products with supercritical CO2 fluid were used to determine extraction yield, fatty acid, tocopherol and phytosterol composition, followed by microencapsulation with two matrices based on the transglutaminase-mediated crosslinking reaction between whey protein isolates and casein. Before microencapsulation, the binding parameters were estimated using quenching studies.


Results and conclusions
The results showed a higher content of total fatty acids when extracted at 40 °C, resulting in two fractions on a dry mass basis of (712±12) mg/g in the fraction obtained in the separator with code S40 and (732±10) mg/g in the fraction obtained in the separator with code S45, respectively. The monounsaturated (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) accounted for 40-44 %. The extracts showed a higher mass fraction of eicosapentaenoic acid ((28.7±1.0) mg/g) in fraction S45 when extracted at 60 °C. A minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentration of 0.66 μg/mL against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 was found for all fractions. Higher binding constants were found for palmitoleic and oleic acids than for palmitic acid. The control variant, without crosslinking, enabled the microencapsulation of a higher amount of fatty acids, while in both powders the sum of MUFAs and PUFAs was 40 %.

Cocrystal technology is an effective method to improve the stability of TMP. Three benzoic acid compounds including P-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), 3-Aminobenzoic acid (MABA), and 3,5-Dinitrobenzoic acid (DNBA) were chosen for co-crystallization with TMP. Three novel cocrystals were obtained, including TMP-PABA (1:2), TMP-MABA (1.5:1), and TMP-DNBA (0.5:1). Hygroscopicity was characterized by the dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) method. Three cocrystals significantly improved the hygroscopicity stability, and the mass change in TMP decreased from 25% to 1.64% (TMP-PABA), 0.12% (TMP-MABA), and 0.03% (TMP-DNBA) at 90% relative humidity. The melting points of the three cocrystals were all higher than TMP, among which the TMP-DNBA cocrystal had the highest melting point and showed the best stability in reducing hygroscopicity. Crystal structure analysis shows that the mesh-like structure formed by the O-H⋯N hydrogen bond in the TMP-DNBA cocrystal was the reason for improving the stability of TMP.",10.3390/molecules29102208

Herein, we tested a stainless-steel (SS) mesh wrapped banana-peel derived biochar (BB) cathode for in-situ H2O2 electrogeneration to degrade bromophenol blue (BPB) and Congo red (CR) dyes. Furthermore, polarity reversal is evaluated for the activation of BB surface via introduction of various oxygen containing functionalities that serve as active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to generate H2O2. Various parameters including the BB mass, current, as well as the solution pH have been optimized to evaluate the cathode performance for efficient H2O2 generation. The results reveal formation of up to 9.4 mg/L H2O2 using 2.0 g BB and 100 mA current in neutral pH with no external oxygen supply with a manganese doped tin oxide deposited nickel foam (Mn-SnO2@NF) anode to facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This iron-free electrofenton (EF) like process enabled by the SSBB cathode facilitates efficient degradation of BPB and CR dyes with 87.44 and 83.63% removal efficiency, respectively after 60 min. A prolonged stability test over 10 cycles demonstrates the effectiveness of polarity reversal toward continued removal efficiency as an added advantage. Moreover, Mn-SnO2@NF anode used for the OER was also replaced with stainless steel (SS) mesh anode to investigate the effect of oxygen evolution on H2O2 generation. Although Mn-SnO2@NF anode exhibits better oxygen evolution potential with reduced Tafel slope, SS mesh anode is discussed to be more cost-efficient for further studies.",10.1016/j.electacta.2023.142351

Herein, we investigated the reactivity of DHP B with bisphenol A (BPA) and related compounds (bisphenol E, bisphenol F, tetrachlorobisphenol A, 2,2'-biphenol, 3,3'-biphenol, 4,4'-biphenol, and 3,3'-dibromo-4,4'-biphenol). As a previously unknown substrate for DHP B, BPA (as a representative substrate) is an endocrine disruptor widely used in polycarbonate and epoxy resins, thus resulting in human exposure. Reactivity studies with these substrates were investigated using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and their corresponding oxidation products were determined by mass spectrometry (GC-MS/ LC-MS). BPA undergoes oxidation in the presence of DHP B and hydrogen peroxide yielding two cleavage products (4-isopropenylphenol and 4-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)phenol), and oligomers with varying degrees of oxidation. 18O-labeling studies confirmed that the O-atom incorporated into the products was derived exclusively from water, consistent with substrate oxidation via a peroxidase-based mechanism. The X-ray crystal structures of DHP bound with bisphenol E (1.48 Å), bisphenol F (1.75 Å), 2,2'-biphenol (1.90 Å) and 3,3'-biphenol (1.30 Å) showed substrate binding sites are in the distal pocket of the heme cofactor, similar to other previously studied DHP substrates. Stopped-flow UV-visible spectroscopy was utilized to investigate the mechanistic details and enzyme oxidation states during substrate turnover, and a reaction mechanism is proposed.

However, the selectivity of 2e transfer from catalysts to O2 is still unsatisfactory, resulting in the insufficient H2O2 availability. Carbon based materials with abundant oxygen-containing functional groups have been used as excellent 2e ORR electrocatalysts, and atomic hydrogen (H*) can quickly transfer one electron to H2O2 in a wide pH range and avoiding the restrict of traditional Fenton reaction. Herein, nickel nanoparticles growth on oxidized carbon deposited on modified carbon felt (Ni/Co@CFAO) was prepared as a bifunctional catalytic electrode coupling 2e ORR to form H2O2 with H* reducing H2O2 to produce ROS for highly efficient degradation of antibiotics. Electrochemical oxidation and thermal treatment were used to modulate the structure of carbon substrates for increasing the electro-generation of H2O2, while H* was produced over Ni sites through H2O/H+ reduction constructing an in-situ EF system. The experimental results indicated that 2e ORR and H* induced EF processes could promote each other mutually. The optimized Ni/Co@CFAO with a Ni:C mass ratio of 1:9 exhibited a high 2e selectivity and H2O2 yield of 49 mg L-1.

A major challenge in developing multidose formulations is the prevention of microbial growth that can potentially be introduced during multiple drawings. The incorporation of antimicrobial preservatives (APs) is a common approach to inhibit this microbial growth. Selection of the right preservative while maintaining drug product stability is often challenging. We explored the effects of three APs, 1.1 % (w/v) benzyl alcohol, 0.62 % (w/v) phenol, and 0.42 % (w/v) m-cresol, on a model immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody, termed the ""NIST mAb."" As measured by hydrogen exchange-mass spectrometry (HX-MS) and differential scanning calorimetry, conformational stability was decreased in the presence of APs. Specifically, flexibility (faster HX) was significantly increased in the CH2 domain (HC 238-255) across all APs. The addition of phenol caused the greatest conformational destabilization, followed by m-cresol and benzyl alcohol. Storage stability studies conducted by subvisible particle (SVP) analysis at 40 °C over 4 weeks further revealed an increase in SVPs in the presence of phenol and m-cresol but not in the presence of benzyl alcohol. However, as monitored by size exclusion chromatography, there was neither a significant change in the monomeric content nor an accumulation of soluble aggregate in the presence of APs.",10.1016/j.ijpharm.2023.123600

The removal of phosphorus by the VES-ATP was conducted by varying the mass ratio of Al to attapulgite (denoted as RmAl/mATP), ATP dosage, and pH. The results showed that the VES-ATP had a good expansion and dispersibility in the presence of alkalized aluminum species. The basicity as the molar ratio of OH to Al (0.8 or 1.6) determined the expansion feasibility, and the coverage degree of Al onto ATP, as indicated by the mass ratio of Al to attapulgite (denoted as RmAl/mATP), determined Al flocculation efficiency. Higher values such as RmAl/mATP = 4:1 and 2:1 may result in a better flocculation. Low phosphorus treatment was successfully achieved through Al flocculation and ATP adsorption, including complexation, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic attraction. As expected, the VES-ATP generated larger size flocs with a bigger fractal dimension than that with the sole Al flocculation.

In this study, we investigate the role of ethanol as a proton shuttle in an electrolyte containing tetrahydrofuran and 0.2 M lithium perchlorate. Particularly designed electrochemical experiments show that ethanol is necessary for a good solid-electrolyte interphase but not for the synthesis of ammonia. In addition, electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) demonstrates that the SEI formation at the onset of lithium plating is of specific importance. Chemical batch synthesis of ammonia combined with real-time mass spectrometry confirms that protons can be shuttled from the anode to the cathode by other species even without ethanol.

Conventional Ammonia production consumes significant energy and causes enormous Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions globally,Ammonia,Carbon dioxide,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,One-Pot Synthesis of Ruthenium-Based Nanocatalyst Using Reduced Graphene Oxide as Matrix for Electrochemical Synthesis of Ammonia.,"Conventional ammonia production consumes significant energy and causes enormous carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions globally. To lower energy consumption and mitigate CO2 emissions, a facile, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective one-pot method for the synthesis of a ruthenium-based nitrogen reduction nanocatalyst has been developed using reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as a matrix. The nanocatalyst synthesis was based on a single-step simultaneous reduction of RuCl3 into ruthenium-based nanoparticles (Ru-based NPs) and graphene oxide (GO) into rGO using glucose as the reducing agent and stabilizer. The obtained ruthenium-based nanocatalyst with rGO as a matrix (Runano-based/rGO) has shown much higher catalytic activity at lower temperatures and pressures for ammonia synthesis than conventional iron catalysts. The rGO worked as a promising promoter for the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia due to its excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. The developed Runano-based/rGO nanocatalyst was characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results demonstrated that the size of the Ru-based NPs on the surface of rGO was 1.9 ± 0.2 nm and the ruthenium content was 25.03 wt %. Bulk electrolysis measurements were conducted on thin-layer electrodes at various cathodic potentials in a N2-saturated 0.1 M H2SO4 electrolyte at room temperature. From the chronoamperometric measurements, the maximum faradic efficiency (F.E.) of 2.1% for ammonia production on the nanostructured Runano-based/rGO electrocatalyst was achieved at a potential of -0.20 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). This electrocatalyst has attained a superior ammonia production rate of 9.14 μg·h-1·mgcat.-1. The results demonstrate the feasibility of reducing N2 into ammonia under ambient conditions and warrant further exploration of the nanostructured Runano-based/rGO for electrochemical ammonia synthesis.",10.1021/acsami.2c18413
"2-Cl-HE was also observed to be the major chlorination product formed from HE with both reagent and enzymatically generated HOCl, just as it was formed ex vivo in different healthy and diseased mouse and human tissues upon incubation with glucose/Glucose oxidase to generate a flux of Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)",Glucose oxidase,Hydrogen,Cause-Effect,component-whole,An improved method for the detection of myeloperoxidase chlorinating activity in biological systems using the redox probe hydroethidine.,"Conversion of the redox probe hydroethidine (HE) to 2-chloroethidium (2-Cl-E+) by myeloperoxidase (MPO)-derived hypochlorous acid (HOCl) provides comparable specificity and superior sensitivity to measurement of 3-chlorotyrosine (3-Cl-Tyr), the gold standard biomarker for MPO chlorinating activity in biological systems. However, a limitation of the former method is the complex mixture of products formed by the reaction of HE with reagent HOCl, coupled with the difficult purification of 2-Cl-E+ from this mixture for analytical purposes. This limitation prompted us to test whether 2-Cl-E+ could be formed by reaction of HE with the strong and widely used chlorinating agent, N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS). Unexpectedly, such reaction yielded 2-chlorohydroethidine (2-Cl-HE) as the major product in addition to 2-Cl-E+, as assessed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry (MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). 2-Cl-HE was also observed to be the major chlorination product formed from HE with both reagent and enzymatically generated HOCl, just as it was formed ex vivo in different healthy and diseased mouse and human tissues upon incubation with glucose/glucose oxidase to generate a flux of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Quantification of 2-Cl-HE plus 2-Cl-E+ improved the sensitivity of the HE-based method compared with measurement of only 2-Cl-E+. Moreover, 2-chlorodimidium (2-Cl-D+) was developed as a practical internal standard instead of the previously used internal standard, deuterated 2-Cl-E+ (d5-2-Cl-E+). Overall, the present study describes an improved method for the detection of MPO/chlorinating activity in biological systems of health and disease.",10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2022.12.014
"Copper-based electrocatalytic materials play a critical role in various electrocatalytic processes, including the electroreduction of Carbon dioxide and nitrate",Copper,Carbon dioxide,Component-Whole,cause-effect,Roughness Factors of Electrodeposited Nanostructured Copper Foams.,"Copper-based electrocatalytic materials play a critical role in various electrocatalytic processes, including the electroreduction of carbon dioxide and nitrate. Three-dimensional nanostructured electrodes are particularly advantageous for electrocatalytic applications due to their large surface area, which facilitates charge transfer and mass transport. However, the real surface area (RSA) of electrocatalysts is a crucial parameter that is often overlooked in experimental studies of high-surface-area copper electrodes. In this study, we investigate the roughness factors of electrodeposited copper foams with varying thicknesses and morphologies, obtained using the hydrogen bubble dynamic template technique. Underpotential deposition (UPD) of metal adatoms is one of the most reliable methods for estimating the RSA of highly dispersed catalysts. We aim to illustrate the applicability of UPD of lead for the determination of the RSA of copper deposits with hierarchical porosity. To find the appropriate experimental conditions that allow for efficient minimization of the limitations related to the slow diffusion of lead ions in the pores of the material and background currents of the reduction of traces of oxygen, we explore the effect of lead ion concentration, stirring rate, scan rate, monolayer deposition time and solution pH on the accuracy of RSA estimates. Under the optimized measurement conditions, Pb UPD allowed to estimate roughness factors as high as 400 for 100 µm thick foams, which translates into a specific surface area of ~6 m2·g-1. The proposed measurement protocol may be further applied to estimate the RSA of copper deposits with similar or higher roughness.",10.3390/nano13233011

Electrocatalytic Water splitting is a promising solution for generating clean Hydrogen,Water,Hydrogen,Cause-Effect,component-whole,A facile synthesis of N-doped carbon encapsulated multimetallic carbonitride as a robust electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction.,"Electrocatalytic water splitting is a promising solution for generating clean hydrogen. Transition metal compounds are among the most extensively investigated catalysts developed to date for water oxidation in alkaline media, a process also known as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the application of these catalysts was constrained by insufficient stability arising from surface oxidation and metal dissolution under high OER potential. In this work, we developed a facile approach using urea-based gel as the precursor of preparing a series of multimetallic carbonitride particles which were encapsulated by N-doped carbon (NC). In particular, (MoCoFeNiZr)CN@NC core-shell structure delivered a low overpotential of 246 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH during OER. Importantly, operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS), together with multiple microscopic and spectroscopic analyses, indicated that the NC shells effectively maintained the crystalline stability of carbonitride via suppressing the surface reconstruction during catalysis. The highly graphitic NC also demonstrates excellent stability against oxidation. This work shows a promising strategy of stabilizing electrocatalyst at high anodic potential, paving the way for the development of robust electrode materials for energy conversion.",10.1016/j.jcis.2024.10.120

To update traditional ""wet"" matrices to dried blood spot (DBS) sampling, based on the liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) technique, and develop a method for simultaneous analyzing caffeine and its three primary metabolites (theobromine, paraxanthine, and theophylline), supporting routine therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for preterm infants.


METHODS
DBS samples were prepared by a two-step quantitative sampling method, i.e., volumetric sampling of a quantitative 10 μL volume of peripheral blood and an 8 mm diameter whole punch extraction by a methanol/water (80/20, v/v) mixture containing 125 mM formic acid.

The present study aimed to assess the role of ferroptosis in hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia‑induced brain damage (HHIBD). Rats were randomly divided into the control, phenylhydrazine (PHZ) and deferoxamine (DFO) + PHZ groups, with 12 rats in each group. Ferroptosis‑associated biochemical and protein indicators were measured in the brain tissue of rats. We also performed tandem mass tag‑labeled proteomic analysis. The levels of iron and malondialdehyde were significantly higher and levels of glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase activity significantly lower in the brain tissues of the PHZ group compared with those in the control group. HHIBD also resulted in significant increases in the expression of the ferroptosis‑related proteins acyl‑CoA synthetase long‑chain family member 4, ferritin heavy chain 1 and transferrin receptor and divalent metal transporter 1, as well as a significant reduction in the expression of ferroptosis suppressor protein 1. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that the differentially expressed proteins of rat brain tissues between the control and PHZ groups were significantly involved in ferroptosis, GSH metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis pathways. Pretreatment with DFO induced antioxidant activity and alleviated lipid peroxidation‑mediated HHIBD. In addition, PC12 cells treated with ferric ammonium citrate showed shrinking mitochondria, high mitochondrial membrane density, and increased lipid reactive oxygen species and intracellular ferrous iron, which were antagonized by pretreatment with ferrostatin‑1 or DFO, which was reversed by pretreatment with ferrostatin‑1 or DFO. The present study demonstrated that ferroptosis is involved in HHIBD and provided novel insights into candidate proteins that are potentially involved in ferroptosis in the brain during hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia.",

However, incorporating non-natural amino acids into a protein is a challenging process needs improvement. In this study, we report a new possible approach to creating nonnatural peptides using ribozymes inspired by the peptidyl transfer center. These RNA scaffolds, which are approximately 100 nucleotides in length, bind to RNase T1 truncated tRNA-like chimeras and bring them into close proximity to facilitate peptide ligation. We used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to show close distances between RNA-RNA, tRNALys-tRNALys, and RNA-tRNALys pairs, which strongly suggests that the mechanism of peptide ligation is due to the proximity of the substrate through dimerization of the enzymes. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the detection of oligopeptides from four amino acids, including L-Lysine, D-Lysine, L-Phenylalanine, and D-Phenylalanine. These results indicate that ribozymes have greater flexibility in accommodating nonnatural amino acids.

In this study, we selected four peanut varieties with contrasting response to salt challenges with T1 and T2 being tolerance and S1 and S2 being susceptible. High-throughput RNA sequencing resulted in more than 314.63 Gb of clean data from 48 samples. We identified 12,057 new genes, 7,971of which have functional annotations.

Na+ content, K+ content, K+/ Na+, and dry mass were measured in root and shoot tissues, and two gene co-expression networks were constructed based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) in root and shoot.

The hub genes include genes encoding ion transport (such as HAK8, CNGCs, NHX, NCL1) protein, aquaporin protein, CIPK11 (CBL-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 11), LEA5 (late embryogenesis abundant protein), POD3 (peroxidase 3), transcription factor, and MAPKKK3. There were some new salt-tolerant genes identified in peanut, including cytochrome P450, vinorine synthase, sugar transport protein 13, NPF 4.5, IAA14, zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein 62, beta-amylase, fatty acyl-CoA reductase 3, MLO-like protein 6, G-type lectin S-receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase, and kinesin-like protein KIN-7B. The identification of key modules, biological pathways, and hub genes in this study enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying salt tolerance in peanuts. This knowledge lays a theoretical foundation for improving and innovating salt-tolerant peanut germplasm.",10.1186/s12870-024-05145-x
"Participants consumed a single serving of Broccoli (n = 16), alfalfa sprouts (n = 16) or collard greens (n = 26) which contained either control unlabeled metabolites, or that were grown in the presence of deuterium-labeled Water to intrinsically label metabolites",Broccoli,Water,Component-Whole,component-whole,Identification of biological signatures of cruciferous vegetable consumption utilizing machine learning-based global untargeted stable isotope traced metabolomics.,"In recent years there has been increased interest in identifying biological signatures of food consumption for use as biomarkers. Traditional metabolomics-based biomarker discovery approaches rely on multivariate statistics which cannot differentiate between host- and food-derived compounds, thus novel approaches to biomarker discovery are required to advance the field. To this aim, we have developed a new method that combines global untargeted stable isotope traced metabolomics and a machine learning approach to identify biological signatures of cruciferous vegetable consumption. Participants consumed a single serving of broccoli (n = 16), alfalfa sprouts (n = 16) or collard greens (n = 26) which contained either control unlabeled metabolites, or that were grown in the presence of deuterium-labeled water to intrinsically label metabolites. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated 133 metabolites in broccoli sprouts and 139 metabolites in the alfalfa sprouts were labeled with deuterium isotopes. Urine and plasma were collected and analyzed using untargeted metabolomics on an AB SCIEX TripleTOF 5,600 mass spectrometer. Global untargeted stable isotope tracing was completed using openly available software and a novel random forest machine learning based classifier. Among participants who consumed labeled broccoli sprouts or collard greens, 13 deuterium-incorporated metabolomic features were detected in urine representing 8 urine metabolites. Plasma was analyzed among collard green consumers and 11 labeled features were detected representing 5 plasma metabolites. These deuterium-labeled metabolites represent potential biological signatures of cruciferous vegetables consumption. Isoleucine, indole-3-acetic acid-N-O-glucuronide, dihydrosinapic acid were annotated as labeled compounds but other labeled metabolites could not be annotated. This work presents a novel framework for identifying biological signatures of food consumption for biomarker discovery. Additionally, this work presents novel applications of metabolomics and machine learning in the life sciences.",10.3389/fnut.2024.1390223

The safety and efficacy of Hb-V have been studied extensively by both preclinical and clinical test methods. Deoxygenation of Hb-V prevents autoxidation of Hb and can extend its shelf life to 2 years at room temperature. However, the lipid components raise concerns about hydrolysis because Hb-V is dispersed in saline. For this study, we attempted to estimate the lipid degradation of long-term stored Hb-V using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Analyses of lipid components extracted from the stored Hb-V showed that the degradation increased depending on the storage temperature. The calculated % remaining of intact lipids of Hb-V were 98.1% after 4 years and 90.4% after 7.2 years at 4 °C, 95.8% after 1 year and 86.7% after 2 years at 25 °C, and 85.6% after 6 months at 40 °C. The main degradation products were lyso-PC and palmitic acid which are hydrolyzed at the ester bond of DPPC. A few hydrolyzed products of DHSG and DSPE-PEG were also detected in Hb-V, but almost no degradation or oxidation products derived from cholesterol could be identified. A shear test of Hb-V at 1500 s-1 showed no significant increase in Hb leakage after storage of 2 years at 25 °C and 6 months at 40 °C. Lipid degradation products including free fatty acids would decrease the pH of the Hb-V dispersion and synergistically facilitate degradation, but it maintained pH 6.5 during 6 years at 4 °C, 2 years at 25 °C, and 3 months at 40 °C because of its high buffering capacity. These results indicate that the storage conditions for Hb-V are appropriate to minimize lipid degradation in the long term.",10.1021/acs.langmuir.4c01403

The EULAR recommendations for the treatment of systemic sclerosis (SSc) were updated in 2017, informed by a systematic literature review (SLR) completed in 2014.


OBJECTIVES
The aim of this new SLR was to provide the most up-to-date literature to underpin contemporary EULAR recommendations for the management of SSc.


METHODS
30 searches for 30 interventions (including several outcomes/clinical questions), and 1 dedicated search (with several interventions) for calcinosis were prioritised by the task force. Three types of questions were defined: type I questions, unchanged as compared with the previous recommendations; type II questions exploring interventions already mentioned in the previous recommendations but with new outcomes; type III questions for new interventions.


RESULTS
14 490 abstracts were retrieved from the databases on 31 March 2022 and 2021 abstracts were retrieved on 11 October 2022. 483 new full texts were evaluated and 172 new articles were included for the first search and 9 for the second search. The majority of the questions covered by this SLR explored new interventions (40% of type III questions) or new outcomes (26% of type II questions). New interventions included targeted therapies such as abatacept, Janus kinase inhibitors or nintedanib, and updated questions incorporated the results from key game-changing randomised controlled trials including trials on tocilizumab, mycophenolate or rituximab in SSc-interstitial lung disease.

To analyze the efficacy and safety of flumatinib, a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) independently developed in China, in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) who falied first-line and second-line treatment.


METHODS
The clinical data of 30 CML-CP patients treated with flumatinib in Lianyungang First People's Hospital from January 2020 to September 2022 were collected retrospectively. Among them, 15 patients who received imatinib first-line treatment but failed treatment were included in the second-line group, and the other 15 patients who failed second-line treatment with nilotinib or dasatinib were included in the third-line group. The hematological and molecular responses of the patients in the two groups at 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment, and the event-free survival (EFS) and adverse reactions of patients at the end of follow-up were statistical analyzed.


RESULTS
At 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment, 10, 11, and 12 patients in the second line group achieved major molecular response (MMR), which was higher than that of 3, 4, and 5 patients in the third line group (P =0.010, P =0.011, P =0.010). At 3 months of treatment, 12 and 13 patients achieved complete hematological response (CHR) and early molecular response (EMR) in the second-line group, which was higher than that of 9 and 13 patients in the third-line group, but the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (P =0.232, P =1.000); At 6 and 12 months of treatment, 6 and 7 patients in the second-line group achieved MR4.5, which were higher than of 3 and 2 cases in the third-line group, but the difference was not statistically significant (P =0.427, P =0.713). The hematological adverse reactions of patients in the second-line group during treatment the period were mainly grade 1-2 thrombocytopenia and anemia, and no grade 3-4 of adverse reactions occurred. In the third-line group, there were 2 cases of grade 1-2 thrombocytopenia, grade 1-2 anemia and white blood cell 3 cases were reduced each, 1 case of grade 3-4 anemia, 2 cases of grade 3-4 neutropenia. The non-hematological adverse reactions in the second-line group were rash (2 cases), headache (1 case), diarrhea (1 case), fatigue (1 case), limb pain (1 case). There were 1 cases of diarrhea, 1 cases of nausea, and 1 cases of edema in the third-line group. There was no statistical significance in hematological and non-hematological adverse reactions between the two groups of patients (P >0.05). At the end of follow-up, the EFS rate of patients in the second-line group was higher than that in the third-line group (100% vs 93.3%), but the difference was not statistically significant (P =0.317).

We evaluated whether the addition of docetaxel (D) to a combination comprising 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) or capecitabine (C) plus oxaliplatin (O) (DOF/DOX) improved overall survival (OS) compared with 6 months of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or capecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX/CAPOX) alone in advanced HER2-negative gastroesophageal junction and gastric adenocarcinomas (G/GEJ).


METHODS
This study was an investigator-initiated, open-label, multi-institutional, randomized phase III trial in adult patients with HER2-negative advanced G/GEJs. The primary endpoint of the study was a comparison of median OS by Kaplan-Meier method. Next-generation sequencing was performed on tissue.


RESULTS
Of the 324 patients randomly assigned between July 2020 and November 2022, 305 patients were evaluable for analysis (FOLFOX/CAPOX: 156; DOF/DOX: 149). With a median follow-up time of 19.2 months (95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 16.5 months to 21.9 months) for the entire cohort, the median OS was 10.1 months (95% CI = 9.2 to 10.9) for FOLFOX/CAPOX and 8.9 months (95% CI = 7.3 to 10.5) for DOF/DOX, and this difference was not statistically significant (P = .70). An increased proportion of grade 3 or grade 4 neutropenia (21% vs 3%; P < .001) and grade 2/3 neuropathy (17% vs 7%; P = .005) was seen in patients receiving DOF/DOX. Genomic profiling revealed a low incidence of microsatellite instability (1%) and a high incidence of BRCA1 (8.4%) and BRCA2 (7.5%) somatic alterations.


CONCLUSION
FOLFOX or CAPOX chemotherapy for 6 months remains one of the standards of care in advanced HER2-negative gastroesophageal junction and gastric adenocarcinomas, with no additional survival benefit seen with the addition of docetaxel. Genomic profiling of patients revealed a higher than previously known incidence of somatic BRCA alterations, which requires further evaluation.CTRI (Clinical Trial Registry of India: CTRI/2020/03/023944).",10.1093/jncics/pkae054

The present study is an 18-month follow-up update of a previously published Italian real-life RRMM cohort of patients treated with EloPd. This revised analysis entered 319 RRMM patients accrued in 41 Italian centers. After a median follow-up of 17.7 months, 213 patients (66.4%) experienced disease progression or died. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 7.5 and 19.2 months, respectively. The updated multivariate analysis showed a significant reduction of PFS benefit magnitude both in advanced International Staging System (ISS) (II and III) stages and previous exposure to daratumumab cases. Instead, advanced ISS (II and III) stages and more than 2 previous lines of therapy maintained an independent prognostic impact on OS. Major adverse events included grade three-fourths neutropenia (24.9%), anemia (13.4%), lymphocytopenia (15.5%), and thrombocytopenia (10.7%), while infection rates and pneumonia were 19.3% and 8.7%, respectively. A slight increase in the incidence of neutropenia and lymphocytopenia was registered with longer follow-up.

Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is a common gram-positive bacterium in pigs. Its natural infection sites are the upper respiratory tract (especially tonsils and nasal cavity), reproductive tract and digestive tract of pigs. It is a new emerging human and animal disease. A co-morbid pathogen that can cause serious infections in humans, including meningitis, sepsis, septic arthritis, and sometimes deafness. No cases have been reported in Huzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China.


Case Presentation
A 50-year-old male patient who had Worked as a butcher in a slaughterhouse for 20 years. Admitted to the hospital due to abdominal pain, joint pain, fever, and headache.His condition rapidly worsened causing altered consciousness, drowsiness and developed hearing loss. S. suis induced pyogenic meningitis complicated by arthritis was suspected based on the results of biochemical and culture analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid, and metagenomic next-generation sequencing, The patient's symptoms significantly improved after treatment with antibiotics such as ceftriaxone, meropenem, and linezolid, as well as supportive therapies including steroids and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and his hearing improved significantly.After about 2 years of follow-up, the hearing was significantly better than before, but hearing impairment still remained.


Conclusion
Streptococcus suis is endemic in pork-consuming and pig-raising countries, but can occur throughout the world, especially among individuals with occupational exposure to pigs and/or pork, such as slaughterhouse workers, butchers, farmers, etc. Strengthen science education among key groups. This case was diagnosed as Streptococcus suis meningitis combined with arthritis. However, abdominal pain in the early stage of the disease is very rare and is easy to be misdiagnosed. It is necessary to identify whether it is complicated by peritonitis.

Choline alfoscerate (alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine) is a phospholipid that includes choline, which increases the release of acetylcholine. The ASCOMALVA trial, a combination of donepezil and choline alfoscerate, slowed cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease. This study aims to replicate the effect by combining donepezil with other nootropics currently used in South Korea.


METHODS
The 119 patients with cognitive decline who were eligible to use donepezil, with an mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score of 26 or less, were assigned to: donepezil alone (DO); donepezil and choline alfoscerate (DN); donepezil and acetyl-l-carnitine (DA); or donepezil and ginkgo biloba extract (DG). Cognitive evaluations such as MMSE, clinical dementia rating, Alzheimer disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), and Alzheimer disease assessment scale-noncognitive subscale were performed at the 12th and 24th weeks from the baseline time point.


RESULTS
At the 12th week, the MMSE score increased 3.52% in the DN group, whereas it increased by 1.36% in the DO group. In the DA + DG group, it decreased by 2.17%. At the 24th week, the MMSE score showed an increase of 1.07% in the DO group and 1.61% in the DN group, but decreased by 5.71% in the DA + DG group. ADAS-Cog decreased by 0.9% in the DO group, while it improved by 13.9% in the DN group at the 12th week. At the 24th week, ADAS-Cog showed improvement in the DN group by 18.5%, whereas it improved by 9.4% in the DO group.

Epidemiological data on opioid use in older individuals are available, but scarce in hospitalized patients.Aims: The aim of this study is to examine the one-day prevalence of opioid use among older inpatients and identify the factors associated with both opioid use and dosage.Materials and methods: One-day cross-sectional study with data collected from geriatric units across 14 Belgian hospitals. The primary focus of the study is to assess the prevalence of opioid use and dosage, along with identifying associated factors. To achieve this, a multiple binary logistic regression model was fitted for opioid use, and a multiple linear regression model for opioid dose.Results: Opioids were used in 24.4% of 784 patients, of which 57.9% was treated with tramadol, 13.2% with oxycodone or morphine and 28.9% with transdermal buprenorphine or fentanyl. The odds for opioid use were 4.2 times higher in patients in orthogeriatric units compared to other patients (OR=4.2, 95% CI=2.50-7.05). The prevalence of opioid use was 34% higher in patients without dementia compared to patients with dementia (OR=0.66, 95% CI=0.46-0.95). The overall mean daily dosage was 14.07mg subcutaneous morphine equivalent. After adjustment for age, gender and dementia, dosage was only associated with type of opioid: the estimated mean opioid dose was 70% lower with tramadol (mean ratio=0,30,95% CI=0,23-0,39) and 67% lower with oxycodone and morphine (mean ratio=0,33, 95% CI=0,22-0,48) compared to transdermal buprenorphine and transdermal fentanyl.Conclusions: One in four patients received opioid treatment. It is not clear whether this reflects under- or overtreatment, but these results can serve as a benchmark for geriatric units to guide future pain management practices.

Mutations in the DNA polymerase delta 1 (POLD1) exonuclease domain cause DNA proofreading defects, hypermutation, hereditary colorectal and endometrial cancer, and are predictive of immunotherapy response. Exonuclease activity is carried out by two magnesium cations, bound to four highly conserved, negatively charged amino acids (AA) consisting of aspartic acid at amino acid position 316 (p.D316), glutamic acid at position 318 (p.E318), p.D402, and p.D515 (termed DEDD motif). Germline polymorphisms resulting in charge-discordant AA substitutions in the DEDD motif are classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) by laboratories and thus would be considered clinically inactionable. We hypothesize this mutation class is clinically pathogenic.


METHODS
A review of clinical presentation was performed in our index patient with a POLD1(p.D402N) heterozygous proband with endometrial cancer. Implications of this mutation class were evaluated by a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-guided systematic review, in silico analysis with orthogonal biochemical confirmation, and whole-exome and RNA sequencing analysis of the patient's tumor and engineered cell lines.


RESULTS
Our systematic review favored a Mendelian disease mutation class associated with endometrial and colorectal cancers. In silico analysis predicted defective protein function, confirmed by biochemical assay demonstrating loss of nuclease activity. A POLD1-specific mutational signature was found in both the patient's tumor and POLD1(p.D402N) overexpressing cell. Furthermore, paired whole-exome/transcriptome analysis of endometrial tumor demonstrated hypermutation and T cell-inflamed gene expression profile (GEP), which are joint predictive biomarkers for pembrolizumab. Our patient showed a deep, durable response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI).


CONCLUSION
Charge-discordant AA substitution in the DEDD motif of POLD1 is detrimental to DNA proofreading and should be reclassified as likely pathogenic and possibly predictive of ICI sensitivity.",10.3390/cancers15235674

This commentary aims to open the discussion on the possible mechanisms connecting the long-term prescribing of these drugs to the elderly and the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases.Abbreviations: AD: Alzheimer disease; APP-βCTF: amyloid beta precursor protein-C-terminal fragment; BACE1: beta-secretase 1; BBB: brain blood barrier; CHX: Ca2+/H+ exchanger; CMI: cognitive mild impairment; CQ: chloroquine; DMARD: disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs; GBA1: glucosylceramidase beta 1; HCQ: hydroxychloroquine; HPLC: high-performance liquid chromatography; LAMP: lysosomal associated membrane protein; MAPK/JNK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPT: microtubule associated protein tau; MCOLN1/TRPML1: mucolipin TRP cation channel 1; NFE2L2/NRF2: NFE2 like bZIP transcription factor 2; NRBF2: nuclear receptor binding factor 2; PANTHOS: poisonous flower; PD: Parkinson disease; PIK3C3: phosphatIdylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3; PPI: proton pump inhibitor; PSEN1: presenilin 1, RUBCN: rubicon autophagy regulator; RUBCNL: rubicon like autophagy enhancer; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TMEM175: transmembrane protein 175; TPCN2: two pore segment channel 2; VATPase: vacuolar-type H+-translocating ATPase; VPS13C: vacuolar protein sorting ortholog 13 homolog C; VPS35: VPS35 retromer complex component; WDFY3: WD repeat and FYVE domain containing 3; ZFYVE1: zinc finger FYVE-type containing 1.",10.1080/15548627.2023.2214960
This article reviews the various metabolites generated in the competing pathways of Tryptophan metabolism including the Kynurenine pathway,Tryptophan,Kynurenine,Component-Whole,component-whole,"The Neurochemistry of Depression: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.","A large constellation of experimental evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is involved in the onset of depression and neurodegenerative disorders. Many studies have shown impairments in tryptophan metabolism, the major pathway for the synthesis of serotonin, the mood regulating neurotransmitter. This article reviews the various metabolites generated in the competing pathways of tryptophan metabolism including the kynurenine pathway. Increased synthesis of the neurotoxic compound quinolinic acid occurs at the expense of the synthesis of the neuroprotective metabolite kynurenic acid. This shift in equilibrium plays a critical role in the induction of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neurotoxicity. Sufficient protein intake with adequate amounts of tryptophan along with dietary antioxidants and flavonoids may offer protection against major depressive and neurodegenerative disorders.",
"AC treatment significantly reduced the levels of monoamine and Acetylcholine neurotransmitters in the brains of rats, including acetylcholine (Ach), Dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT)",Acetylcholine,Dopamine,Component-Whole,cause-effect,"Protective effect of compatible herbs in Jin-Gu-Lian formula against Alangium chinense-induced neurotoxicity via oxidative stress, neurotransmitter metabolisms, and pharmacokinetics.","Background: A. chinense frequently used in Miao medicine to treat rheumatic diseases. However, as a famous toxic herb, Alangium chinense and its representative components exhibit ineluctable neurotoxicity, thus creating significant challenges for clinical application. The combined application with compatible herbs in Jin-Gu-Lian formula attenuates such neurotoxicity according to the compatible principle of traditional Chinese medicines. Purpose: We aimed to investigate the detoxification of the compatible herbs in Jin-Gu-Lian formula on A. chinense-induced neurotoxicity and investigate its mechanism. Methods: Neurobehavioral and pathohistological analysis were used to determine the neurotoxicity in rats administered with A. chinense extract (AC), extract of compatible herbs in Jin-Gu-Lian formula (CH) and combination of AC with CH for 14 days. The mechanism underlying the reduction of toxicity by combination with CH was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, spectrophotometric assays, liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry and real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Compatible herbs attenuated the AC-induced neurotoxicity as evidenced by increased locomotor activity, enhanced grip strength, the decreased frequency of AC-induced morphological damage in neurons, as well as a reduction of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and neurofilament light chain (NEFL) levels. The combination of AC and CH ameliorated AC-induced oxidative damage by modulating the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC). AC treatment significantly reduced the levels of monoamine and acetylcholine neurotransmitters in the brains of rats, including acetylcholine (Ach), dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT). Combined AC and CH treatment regulated the abnormal concentrations and metabolisms of neurotransmitters. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the co-administration of AC and CH significantly decreased plasma exposure levels of two main components of AC, as evidenced by the reduction of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) compared to AC. In addition, the AC-induced downregulation in mRNA expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes was significantly reduced in response to combined AC and CH treatment. Conclusion: Compatible herbs in Jin-Gu-Lian formula alleviated the neurotoxicity induced by A. chinense by ameliorating oxidative damage, preventing abnormality of neurotransmitters and modulating pharmacokinetics.",10.3389/fphar.2023.1133982

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are significant neurodegenerative disorders with increasing prevalence worldwide. Lifestyle and dietary factors, including micronutrients, have been suggested as modifiable risk factors for disease development. This study aims to investigate the association between micronutrients and cognitive ability in these diseases.


METHODS
A cross-sectional study involving 105 participants with MCI and AD was conducted. Dietary assessments were performed using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and micronutrient intake was calculated based on nutrient content. Disease severity was evaluated using the Functional Assessment Staging Tool (FAST). Statistical analyses, including correlation coefficients and multiple regression models, were employed to examine the association between micronutrients and disease progression.


RESULTS
The results revealed significant correlations between disease severity and several micronutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids (B = -0.2, P = 0.01), carotenoids (B = -0.19, P = 0.02), dietary antioxidant compounds, including vitamins A, C, D, E (B = -0.19, P = 0.02), selenium (B = -0.17, P = 0.03), alpha-carotene (B = -0.16, P = 0.04), beta-carotene (B = -0.17, P = 0.03), and lycopene (B = -0.16, P = 0.04). Multivariate regression analysis showed that higher intake of omega-3 fatty acids was associated with slower disease progression. Furthermore, the levels of these micronutrients declined in advanced stages of the disease.


CONCLUSION
Omega-3 fatty acids and carotenoids may affect the cognitive ability and disease progression. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to establish causality and explore the therapeutic implications of these findings for the prevention and management of MCI and AD.",10.1186/s12883-024-03800-2

It has been described that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) favors an antioxidant environment and inhibits kynurenine aminotransferase II activity (KAT II, the main enzyme of KYNA production), leading to brain KYNA levels decrease and cognitive improvement. This study aimed to investigate whether the NAC modulation of the brain KYNA levels in mice ameliorated Pb2+-induced cognitive impairment. The dams were divided into four groups: Control, Pb2+, NAC, and Pb2++NAC, which were given drinking water or 500 ppm lead acetate in the drinking water ad libitum, from 0 to 23 postnatal days (PNDs). The NAC and Pb2++NAC groups were simultaneously fed NAC (350 mg/day) in their chow from 0 to 23 PNDs. At PND 60, the effect of the treatment with Pb2+ and in combination with NAC on learning and memory performance was evaluated. Immediately after behavioral evaluation, brain tissues were collected to assess the redox environment; KYNA and glutamate levels; and KAT II activity. The NAC treatment prevented the long-term memory deficit exhibited in the Pb2+ group. As expected, Pb2+ group showed redox environment alterations, fluctuations in glutamate levels, and an increase in KYNA levels, which were partially avoided by NAC co-administration. These results confirmed that the excessive KYNA levels induced by Pb2+ were involved in the onset of cognitive impairment and could be successfully prevented by NAC treatment. NAC could be a tool for testing in scenarios in which KYNA levels are associated with the induction of cognitive impairment.",10.3390/antiox12122035

Betaine (BET), a trimethyl glycine, possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic functions, although the underlying mechanisms of the role of BET on fluoride-induced neurotoxicity remain unelucidated. To assess the mechanism involved in the neuro-restorative role of BET on behavioural, neurochemical, and histological changes, we employed a rat model of sodium fluoride (NaF) exposure. Animals were treated with NaF (9 mg/kg) body weight (bw) only or co-treated with BET (50 and 100 mg/kg bw) orally uninterrupted for 28 days. We obtained behavioural phenotypes in an open field, performed negative geotaxis, and a forelimb grip test, followed by oxido-inflammatory, apoptotic, and histological assessment. Behavioural endpoints indicated lessened locomotive and motor and heightened anxiety-like performance and upregulated oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic biomarkers in NaF-exposed rats. Co-treatment with BET significantly enhanced locomotive, motor, and anxiolytic performance, increased the antioxidant signalling mechanisms and demurred oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic biomarkers and histoarchitectural damage in the cerebrum and cerebellum cortices mediated by NaF. The in-silico analysis suggests that multiple hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions of BET with critical amino acid residues, including arginine (ARG380 and ARG415) in the Keap1 Kelch domain, which may disrupt Keap1-Nrf2 complex and activate Nrf2. This may account for the observed increased in the Nrf2 levels, elevated antioxidant response and enhanced anti-inflammatory response. The BET-Keap1 complex was also observed to exhibit structural stability and conformational flexibility in solvated biomolecular systems, as indicated by the thermodynamic parameters computed from the trajectories obtained from a 100 ns full atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. Therefore, BET mediates neuroprotection against NaF-induced cerebro-cerebellar damage through rats' antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic activity, which molecular interactions with Keap1-Nrf2 may drive.",10.1186/s40360-024-00812-z

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the neuroprotective potential of berberine, levetiracetam and their combination in lead acetate-induced neurotoxicity by applying a drug repositioning approach.


BACKGROUND
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by impairment of memory, disturbances in reasoning, planning, language and perception. Currently, there are only four drugs approved by US-FDA for AD; therefore, there is an extensive need for new drug development. The drug repositioning approach refers to the development of new uses for existing or abandoned pharmaceuticals. Several studies support the neuroprotective abilities of anti-oxidants resulting in neuronal protection against neurotoxins, suppression of oxidative stress and promotion of memory, learning and cognitive functions. Many natural polyphenols are being investigated as a potential therapeutic option for AD. Levetiracetam (LEV), a second-generation antiepileptic drug, is a new molecule that is clearly differentiated from conventional antiepileptic drugs by its pharmacologic properties. LEV also has been previously demonstrated to protect against oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity in several models of seizures. Berberine (BBR) is an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant phytoconstituent.


OBJECTIVE
To study the therapeutic effect of berberine, levetiracetam and their physical mixture in lead acetate-induced neurotoxicity in Swiss albino mice for probable application in the management of Alzheimer's disease.


METHODS
Neurotoxicity was induced in Swiss albino mice by lead acetate. Behavioural parameters, such as transfer latency time and percentage alternation, were studied using Morris water maze (MWM), Elevated plus-maze test (EPM) and Y-maze for the assessment of improvement in learning and memory. Concentrations of acetylcholinesterase, MDA and GSH in the brain were also estimated. Brain samples were subjected to histopathological studies.


RESULTS
Results revealed that the combination of BBR and LEV exhibited a significant neuroprotective effect by decreasing escape latency time and increasing time spent in the target quadrant in MWM. The combination also decreases transfer latency time in EPM and acetylcholinesterase levels in the brain as compared to standard donepezil. Reduced neuronal damage was also confirmed by the histopathological report.


CONCLUSION
Leveteracitam, berberin and their combination resulted in the significant conservation of various behavioural, biochemical, enzymatic and anti-oxidant parameters that were evaluated. The neuroprotective effect of plain leveteracitam and berberin was significantly better than their combination. The anticipated synergism or additive effect was not observed with the combination of leveteracitam and berberin in lead acetate-induced neurotoxicity.",10.2174/2772432816666210910104306

In this lagoon, the clam Ruditapes decussatus has been widely used as a biomonitor of seawater pollution through measurements of parameters related to oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. However, few studies have considered parameters of the immune system of this species in the South Lagoon of Tunis. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to evaluate several immune-related parameters in the cell-free haemolymph of carpet shell clams sampled during August and February from three polluted sites in the South Lagoon of Tunis (S1, S2 and S3) and one less polluted site as a reference site (RS) in order to identify suitable biomarkers for environmental quality assessments of this ecosystem. Concerning the immune-related parameters, seasonal factors modulated phenoloxidase, lysozyme, protease and esterase activity, with lower values measured for samples collected in August than for samples collected in February. In fact, bactericidal activity against two of the pathogenic bacteria tested and the activity of most immune-related enzymes were reduced in the cell-free haemolymph of clams collected from the most sampling sites in August compared to February one. In addition, values of abiotic parameters (temperature, salinity and pH) and metal (cadmium, copper, iron, lead and zinc) concentrations in the clams' soft tissues, previously obtained and published by the authors, as well as the values of immune-related parameters were integrated using principal component analyses. Results indicated that the values of all measured immune-related parameters were negatively correlated with the temperature values and the variations most of these parameters highlighted that the chemical industrial area (S3) was the most impacted location within the South Lagoon of Tunis. The present study illustrates that the immune-related parameters measured in carpet shell clam cell-free haemolymph represent suitable biomarkers for environmental quality assessments because they provide effective seasonal and spatial discrimination.",10.1007/s11356-022-22902-3
"Additional studies using live-cell imaging of neurons expressing a redox-sensitive GFP targeted to the mitochondrial matrix show that treatment with Homocysteine leads to a progressive increase in mitochondrial reactive Oxygen species generation, which is dependent on GluN2A-NMDAR-mediated sustained ERK MAPK activation",Homocysteine,Oxygen,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Homocysteine-induced sustained GluN2A NMDA receptor stimulation leads to mitochondrial ROS generation and neurotoxicity.,"Homocysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid derived from methionine metabolism, is a known agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and is involved in neurotoxicity. Our previous findings showed that neuronal exposure to elevated homocysteine levels leads to sustained low-level increase in intracellular Ca2+, which is dependent on GluN2A subunit-containing NMDAR (GluN2A-NMDAR) stimulation. These studies further showed a role of ERK MAPK in homocysteine-GluN2A-NMDAR-mediated neuronal death. However, the intracellular mechanisms associated with such sustained GluN2A-NMDAR stimulation and subsequent Ca2+ influx have remained unexplored. Using live-cell imaging with Fluo3-AM and biochemical approaches, we show that homocysteine-GluN2A NMDAR-induced initial Ca2+ influx triggers sequential phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the proline rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) and Src family kinases, which in turn phosphorylates GluN2A-Tyr1325 residue of GluN2A-NMDARs to maintain channel activity. The continuity of this cycle of events leads to sustained Ca2+ influx through GluN2A-NMDAR. Our findings also show that lack of activation of the regulatory tyrosine phosphatase STEP, which can limit Pyk2 and Src family kinase activity further contributes to the maintenance of this cycle. Additional studies using live-cell imaging of neurons expressing a redox-sensitive GFP targeted to the mitochondrial matrix show that treatment with homocysteine leads to a progressive increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation, which is dependent on GluN2A-NMDAR-mediated sustained ERK MAPK activation. This later finding demonstrates a novel role of GluN2A-NMDAR in homocysteine-induced mitochondrial ROS generation and highlights the role of ERK MAPK as the intermediary signaling pathway between GluN2A-NMDAR stimulation and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation.",10.1016/j.jbc.2024.107253

However, limitations such as poor blood-brain barrier penetration and acquired resistance, particularly the ROS1 G2032R solvent-front mutation, hinder treatment durability. Repotrectinib, a next-generation macrocyclic TKI, was rationally designed to overcome on-target resistance mutations and improve brain distribution through its low molecular weight. In the TRIDENT-1 clinical trial, repotrectinib demonstrated significant efficacy in both TKI-naïve and TKI-pretreated patients with ROS1-rearranged NSCLC, including those with CNS metastases and G2032R resistance mutations. In the TKI-naïve cohort (n = 71), 79% of patients achieved an objective response, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 35.7 months, surpassing all previously approved ROS1 TKIs. In patients who had received one prior ROS1 TKI but were chemotherapy-naïve (n = 56), objective responses were observed in 38%, and median PFS was 9.0 months. The safety profile of repotrectinib was consistent with earlier-generation ROS1 TKIs and common adverse events included anemia, neurotoxicity, increased creatine kinase levels, and weight gain.

The aim of this study was to identify a viable resolution for the embolism resulting from intravascular administration of PCL-containing fillers.


METHODS
Two different animal experiments were performed: (1) PCL-induced rat inferior epigastric arteries embolism, followed by gross observation, histological evaluation, and cytokines analysis from serum; and (2) PCL-induced rabbit auricular artery embolism, immediately treated with heparin and nitroglycerin. The ears were then evaluated by gross observation, Laser speckle imaging, in vivo imaging system (IVIS) imaging, and histological evaluation. Saline and hyaluronic acids (HA) were used as controls, hyaluronidase was used as a positive drug.


RESULTS
In a rat model of inferior epigastric arteries embolism, both intravascular injection of HA and PCL resulted in flap necrosis, indicating that the filler-induced intravascular embolism can lead to serious complications. In a rabbit model of auricular artery embolism, the combination treatment of heparin and nitroglycerin resulted in a relative blood reperfusion recovery of 80% in the ischemic area of the PCL group on day 7 post-operation, which was comparable to that of the HA group treated with hyaluronidase. Histological analysis revealed that the administration of heparin and nitroglycerin significantly attenuated intravascular thrombosis formation and inflammatory cell aggregation.


CONCLUSIONS
The combination of heparin and nitroglycerin effectively restores blood flow reperfusion in the intravascular embolization caused by PCL filler injection, alleviates local tissue edema and flap necrosis. These findings offer a novel approach for future clinical management of intravascular embolization with PCL-containing filler injection.

"Previous research has revealed that IBD patients often have a deficiency of Choline and its metabolites, including Acetylcholine (ACh) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), within the colon",Choline,Acetylcholine,Component-Whole,component-whole,CDP-choline modulates cholinergic signaling and gut microbiota to alleviate DSS-induced inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) represent chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders characterized by a complex and underexplored pathogenic mechanism. Previous research has revealed that IBD patients often have a deficiency of choline and its metabolites, including acetylcholine (ACh) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), within the colon. However, a comprehensive study linking these three substances and their mechanistic implications in IBD remains lacking. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and underlying mechanism of cytidine diphosphate (CDP)-choline (citicoline), an intermediate product of choline metabolism, in a mouse model of IBD induced by dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS). The results demonstrated that CDP-choline effectively alleviated colonic inflammation and deficiencies in choline, ACh, and PC by increasing the raw material. Further detection showed that CDP-choline also increased the ACh content by altering the expression of high-affinity choline transporter (ChT1) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in DSS-induced mice colon. Moreover, CDP-choline increased the expression of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) and activated the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP), leading to reduced colon macrophage activation and proinflammatory M1 polarization in IBD mice, thus reducing the levels of TNF-α and IL-6. In addition, CDP-choline reduced intestinal ecological imbalance and increased the content of hexanoic acid in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in mice. In conclusion, this study elucidates the ability of CDP-choline to mitigate DSS-induced colon inflammation by addressing choline and its metabolites deficiencies, activating the CAP, and regulating the composition of the intestinal microbiome and SCFAs content, providing a potential prophylactic and therapeutic approach for IBD.",10.1016/j.bcp.2023.115845
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) can enzymatically hydrolyze Acetylcholine (ACh) to generate Acetic acid,Acetylcholine,Acetic acid,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Electrochemiluminescence enhanced by isolating ACQphores in imine-linked covalent organic framework for organophosphorus pesticide assay.,"Most of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are non or weakly emissive due to either the molecular thermal motion-mediated energy dissipation or the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect. Herein, we synthesize an imine-linked COF (TFPPy-TPh-COF) with high electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emission and the capability of eliminating the ACQ effect and further construct an ECL sensor for malathion detection. The imine-linked COF is obtained by the condensation reaction of (1,1':3',1″-terphenyl)-4,4″-diamine (TPh) and 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(p-formylphenyl)pyrene (TFPPy), and it has higher ECL efficiency than TFPPy aggregates due to the separation of ACQ luminophores (i.e., TFPPy) from each other by TPh and the restriction of intramolecular motions of TFPPy and TPh to reduce the nonradiative decay. The efficient quenching of ECL is achieved by electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (ERET) from the excited state of the TFPPy-TPh-COF to zeolite imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) and the steric hindrance of ZIF-8. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) can enzymatically hydrolyze acetylcholine (ACh) to generate acetic acid. The resultant acetic acid can trigger the dissolution of ZIF-8 to produce an enhanced ECL signal. Malathion as an organophosphorus pesticide serves as an AChE inhibitor to prevent the production of acetic acid, inducing the decrease of ECL signal. This sensor displays a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.44 pg/mL and a wide dynamic detection range of 0.01-1000 ng/mL. Furthermore, it can be used to detect other organophosphates pesticides (e.g., methidathion, chlorpyrifos, and paraoxon) and measure malathion in real samples (i.e., pakchoi, lettuce, and apples).",10.1016/j.talanta.2023.124964
"In this study, we examined the comparative effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor Dapagliflozin (SGLT2i group, n = 53) and the combined use of dapagliflozin and conventional diuretics, including loop diuretics and/or thiazides (SGLT2i + diuretic group, n = 23), on serum copeptin, a stable, sensitive, and simple surrogate marker of Vasopressin release and body fluid status",Dapagliflozin,Vasopressin,Component-Whole,cause-effect,Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitor Combined with Conventional Diuretics Ameliorate Body Fluid Retention without Excessive Plasma Volume Reduction.,"We previously reported that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors exert sustained fluid homeostatic actions through compensatory increases in osmotic diuresis-induced vasopressin secretion and fluid intake. However, SGLT2 inhibitors alone do not produce durable amelioration of fluid retention. In this study, we examined the comparative effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin (SGLT2i group, n = 53) and the combined use of dapagliflozin and conventional diuretics, including loop diuretics and/or thiazides (SGLT2i + diuretic group, n = 23), on serum copeptin, a stable, sensitive, and simple surrogate marker of vasopressin release and body fluid status. After six months of treatment, the change in copeptin was significantly lower in the SGLT2i + diuretic group than in the SGLT2i group (-1.4 ± 31.5% vs. 31.5 ± 56.3%, p = 0.0153). The change in the estimated plasma volume calculated using the Strauss formula was not significantly different between the two groups. Contrastingly, changes in interstitial fluid, extracellular water, intracellular water, and total body water were significantly lower in the SGLT2i + diuretic group than in the SGLT2i group. Changes in renin, aldosterone, and absolute epinephrine levels were not significantly different between the two groups. In conclusion, the combined use of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin and conventional diuretics inhibited the increase in copeptin levels and remarkably ameliorated fluid retention without excessively reducing plasma volume and activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems.",10.3390/diagnostics14111194

Its increasing drug resistance drives the search for more effective antifungal agents. Therefore, we assessed toxicological parameters and the antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of action of the monoterpene (-)-fenchone against oral C. albicans. We conducted an in silico study using PASS online and AdmetSAR, followed by evaluation of antifungal activity through Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC), association study with miconazole, and assays with sorbitol and ergosterol. Inhibition of biofilm formation and disruption of preformed biofilm were considered. Toxicity was also assessed through hemolysis assay. The in silico study revealed a higher likelihood of the compound being active for antifungal activity, as well as promising pharmacokinetic and toxicity characteristics. Subsequently, (-)-fenchone exhibited predominantly fungicidal activity (MIC90 = 8 μg/mL; MFC = 16 μg/mL), including against miconazole-resistant C. albicans isolates. The substance does not appear to act by damaging the fungal cell wall or plasma membrane, and exhibited synergy with miconazole. There was activity in inhibiting biofilm formation but not in disrupting preformed biofilm. Finally, the product exerted low hemolytic activity at more than MIC×10.

The single-arm, phase II SORAYA trial (NCT04296890) of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx in folate receptor alpha (FRα)-high platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (n=105 (efficacy-evaluable)) met its primary endpoint with an objective response rate of 32.4% (95% CI, 23.6 to 42.2). Here we report final SORAYA trial results for overall survival and post hoc objective response rates in subgroups by sequence and number of prior therapies.


METHODS
Eligible patients had high-grade serous platinum-resistant ovarian cancer with high FRα expression and one to three prior therapies (prior bevacizumab required). Enrolled participants received 6 mg/kg mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx adjusted ideal body weight intravenously once every 3 weeks until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death. Final overall survival and post hoc objective response rates were assessed in efficacy-evaluable participants. The safety population included all patients who received ≥1 dose of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx.


RESULTS
At data cut-off (December 22, 2022; n=105), final median overall survival was 15.0 months (95% CI, 11.5 to 18.7). Median overall survival in participants with one to two prior therapy lines was 18.7 months (95% CI, 13.8 to not estimable (NE)) and 11.6 months (95% CI, 7.1 to 16.7) with three prior therapy lines. Median overall survival was 15.0 months (95% CI, 11.5 to NE) in participants with prior poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) treatment versus 14.0 months (95% CI, 7.1 to NE) in those without. Objective response rate (data cut-off: November 17, 2021) differed among participants who received mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx as their first treatment in the platinum-resistant setting (34.8%; 95% CI, 23.5 to 47.6) versus a different first treatment (28.2%; 95% CI, 15.0 to 44.9) or had received prior bevacizumab in a platinum-sensitive (34.0%; 95% CI, 24.6 to 44.5) versus platinum-resistant setting (17.6%; 95% CI, 3.8 to 43.4). No new safety signals were observed.


CONCLUSION
These results support the clinically meaningful efficacy of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx in FRα-expressing platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, irrespective of prior treatment or sequence.",10.1136/ijgc-2024-005401

The efficacy and safety of rucaparib after PARPi therapy are largely unknown; therefore, we analyzed outcomes in the subgroup of PARPi-pretreated patients from Spanish hospitals participating in the Rucaparib Access Program. This post hoc subgroup analysis explored baseline characteristics, treatment exposure, safety, effectiveness, and subsequent therapy among women receiving rucaparib 600 mg twice daily after at least one prior PARPi for HGOC. Of 14 women eligible for the analysis, 11 (79%) had tumors harboring BRCA1/2 mutations. Patients had received a median of 5 (range 3-8) treatment lines before rucaparib. Twelve patients (86%) had previously received olaparib and two (14%) niraparib; 12 patients received rucaparib as treatment for platinum-resistant HGOC, one as treatment for platinum-sensitive HGOC, and one as maintenance therapy. Progression-free survival was 0.2-9.1 months. One of seven patients assessable for response by RECIST achieved stable disease. Adverse events occurred in 11 patients (79%; grade 3 in 29%), leading to treatment interruption in eight patients (57%), dose reduction in six (43%), but treatment discontinuation in only one (7%). No new safety signals were observed. This is one of the first reported series of real-world data on rucaparib after prior PARPi for HGOC. In this heavily pretreated population, rucaparib demonstrated meaningful activity in some patients and tolerability consistent with previous prospective trials. Future investigation should focus on identifying patients who may benefit from rucaparib after prior PARPi exposure.",10.1016/j.gore.2023.101211
"Importantly, by performing the drug sensitivity analysis, we found that the OSC patients in the low-risk group were more sensitive to cisplatin, paclitaxel and Docetaxel than those in the high-risk group, while the latter ones were more sensitive to VEGFR inhibitor Axitinib and BRAF inhibitors Vemurafenib and SB590885",Docetaxel,Axitinib,Component-Whole,cause-effect,Prognosis prediction and drug guidance of ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma through mitochondria gene-based model.,"BACKGROUND
Mitochondrial dysregulation contributes to the chemoresistance of multiple cancer types. Yet, the functions of mitochondrial dysregulation in Ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OSC) remain largely unknown.


AIM
We sought to investigate the function of mitochondrial dysregulation in OSC from the bioinformatics perspective. We aimed to establish a model for prognosis prediction and chemosensitivity evaluation of the OSC patients by targeting mitochondrial dysregulation.


METHODS
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-OV dataset and the mitochondrial-related DEGs were identified from the Human MitoCarta 3.0 database. Prognosis-related mitochondria-related genes (MRGs) were screened to establish the MRGs-based risk score model for prognosis prediction. To validate the risk score model, the risk score model was then evaluated by IHC staining intensity and survival curves from clinical specimens of OSC patients. Migration and proliferation assays were performed to elucidate the role of carcinogenic gene ACSS3 in serous ovarian cancer cell lines.


RESULTS
Using consensus clustering algorithm, we identified 341 MRGs and two subtypes of OSC patients. Moreover, we established a novel prognostic risk score model by combining the transcription level, intensity and extent scores of MRGs for prognosis prediction purpose. The model was established using 7 MRGs (ACOT13, ACSS3, COA6, HINT2, MRPL14, NDUFC2, and NDUFV2) significantly correlated to the prognosis of OSC. Importantly, by performing the drug sensitivity analysis, we found that the OSC patients in the low-risk group were more sensitive to cisplatin, paclitaxel and docetaxel than those in the high-risk group, while the latter ones were more sensitive to VEGFR inhibitor Axitinib and BRAF inhibitors Vemurafenib and SB590885. In addition, patients in the low-risk group were predicted to have better response in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy than those in the high-risk group. The risk score model was then validated by survival curves of high-risk and low-risk groups determined by IHC staining scores of OSC clinical samples. The carcinogenic effect of ACSS3 in OSC was confirmed through the knockdown of ACSS3 in SKOV3 and HO-8910 cells.


CONCLUSION
To summarize, we established a novel 7 MRGs - based risk score model that could be utilized for prognosis prediction and chemosensitivity assessment in OSC patients.",10.1016/j.cancergen.2024.12.005

Lactic acid, a key metabolite produced from the glycolytic metabolism of glucose molecules, is correlated with tumor immune infiltration and platinum resistance. In our previous study, we found that endothelial cell-specific molecule 1 (ESM1) plays a key role in OC progression. This study revealed that lactate could upregulate ESM1, which enhances SCD1 to attenuate the antitumor CD8+ T-cell response. ESM1 and SCD1 expression levels were significantly greater in OC patients with high lactic acid levels than in those with low lactic acid levels. Further mechanistic studies suggested that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway was inactivated after ESM1 knockdown and rescued by SCD1 overexpression. IC50 analysis indicated that the ESM1-SCD1 axis induces the resistance of OC cells to platinum agents, including cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin, by upregulating P-gp. In conclusion, our study indicated that the induction of SCD1 by lactic acid-induced ESM1 can impede the CD8+ T-cell response against tumors and promote resistance to cisplatin by activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in ovarian cancer. Consequently, targeting ESM1 may have considerable therapeutic potential for modulating the tumor immune microenvironment and enhancing drug sensitivity in OC patients.",10.1016/j.intimp.2024.112461

Chemotherapy for high-grade serous ovarian cancers in Platinum-sensitive relapse includes Carboplatin/paclitaxel, carboplatin/gemcitabine, and carboplatin/pegylated liposomal doxorubicin",Platinum,Carboplatin,Component-Whole,component-whole,Efficacy of chemotherapy according to BRCA status in patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma at first platinum-sensitive relapse.,"OBJECTIVE
Chemotherapy for high-grade serous ovarian cancers in platinum-sensitive relapse includes carboplatin/paclitaxel, carboplatin/gemcitabine, and carboplatin/pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. According to in vitro data, BRCA mutated patients are sensitive to replicative stress agents but BRCA status is not yet used for the choice of chemotherapy at relapse. Our aim was to assess these doublets according to BRCA status in first platinum-sensitive relapse.


METHODS
The ESME ovarian cancer database comprises a multicenter retrospective cohort of patients with ovarian cancer treated in French cancer centers between January 2011 and December 2017. Patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancers at first platinum-sensitive relapse who received one of these doublets were included. The objective was to compare progression-free survival of each chemotherapy doublet according to BRCA status.


RESULTS
Among the 10 263 patients in the database, 1539 patients had a first platinum-sensitive relapse: 825 BRCA wild type patients (53.6%) and 304 BRCA mutated patients (19.8%) (7 patients had a homologous recombination mutation and BRCA status was unkown for 403 patients). Median progression-free survival was longer in BRCA mutated patients than in BRCA wild type patients when receiving carboplatin/pegylated liposomal doxorubicin without maintenance treatment (15.8 vs 11.8 months; p<0.001). In contrast, we observed no difference in patients treated with carboplatin/paclitaxel (14.6 vs 14.3 months, respectively; p=0.70) or in those treated with carboplatin/gemcitabine (12.0 vs 9.8 months, respectively; p=0.18). In BRCA wild type patients without maintenance, better progression-free survival occurred with carboplatin/paclitaxel (median progression-free survival 14.3 months) than with carboplatin/gemcitabine and carboplatin/pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (9.8 and 11.8 months, respectively; p=0.017). In BRCA mutated patients without maintenance, there was no difference between the three doublets (median progression-free survival of 14.6, 12.0, and 15.8 months with carboplatin/paclitaxel, carboplatin/gemcitabine, and carboplatin/pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, respectively; p=0.40).


CONCLUSION
While treatment with carboplatin/paclitaxel, carboplatin/gemcitabine, and carboplatin/pegylated liposomal doxorubicin shows comparable efficacy in BRCA mutated patients, treatment with carboplatin/paclitaxel appears to be more effective than carboplatin/gemcitabine and carboplatin/pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in BRCA wild type patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancers at first platinum-sensitive relapse.",10.1136/ijgc-2022-003993

As such, they may also impact the consumption of their hosts and/or be involved in the digestion or detoxification of the host's diet. To study such effects of a gregarine species on those traits in its host, the mustard leaf beetle (Phaedon cochleariae) was used. This beetle species feeds on Brassicaceae plants that contain glucosinolates, which form toxic compounds when hydrolyzed by myrosinases. We cleaned host eggs from gametocysts and spores and reinfected half of the larvae with gregarines, to obtain gregarine-free (G-) and gregarine-infected (G+) larvae. Growth and food consumption parameters of these larvae were assessed by rearing individuals on watercress (Nasturtium officinale, Brassicaceae). A potential involvement of gregarines in the glucosinolate metabolism of P. cochleariae larvae was investigated by offering G- and G+ larvae leaf discs of watercress (containing mainly the benzenic 2-phenylethyl glucosinolate and myrosinases) or pea (Pisum sativum, Fabaceae, lacking glucosinolates and myrosinases) treated with the aliphatic 4-pentenyl glucosinolate or the indole 1-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl glucosinolate. Larval and fecal samples were analyzed via UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS to search for breakdown metabolites. Larval development, body mass, growth rate and efficiency to convert food into body mass were negatively affected by gregarine infection while the pupal mass remained unaffected. The breakdown metabolites of benzenic and aliphatic glucosinolates were conjugated with aspartic acid, while those of the indole glucosinolate were conjugated with glutamic acid. Gregarine infection did not alter the larvae's ability to metabolize glucosinolates and was independent of plant myrosinases. In summary, some negative effects of gregarines on host performance could be shown, indicating parasitism. Future studies may further disentangle this gregarine-host relationship and investigate the microbiome potentially involved in the glucosinolate metabolism.",10.3389/fphys.2024.1394576

It is believed that the induction of oxidative stress resulting from the inhibition of antioxidant enzyme activities and changes in drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver could explain the role of cadmium in the development of different diseases in the kidney and probably other organs. Changes in oxidative stress markers, antioxidant enzymes, and drug-metabolizing enzyme activities were assessed in the liver of male rats exposed to cadmium chloride. Additionally, the protective effects of silymarin and garlic extract against cadmium toxicosis were evaluated. Rats were randomly divided into eight groups as follows, groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, received orally saline, CdCl2 (1 mg/kg), garlic extract [800 mg/kg], silymarin (25 mg/kg) and silymarin plus garlic extract respectively for 28 consecutive days. Rats in groups 6, 7, and 8 were pretreated with the same doses of garlic, silymarin, and garlic plus silymarin, respectively for two hours before cadmium administration. The Western immunoblotting technique was used to investigate the protein expression of cytochrome P450 isozymes. Spectrophotometric methods were used to assess the activity of both antioxidant- and drug-metabolizing enzymes. Free radical levels [measured as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)], catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase activities increased whereas the levels of glutathione and the activities of glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase, and glutamyl transferase, cytochrome P450, aryl hydrocarbon dehydrogenase (AHH), dimethylnitrosamine-N-demethylase I (DMN-dI), 7-ethoxycoumarine-O-deethylase (ECOD), cytochrome b5 and NADPH-Cytochrome-c-reductase enzyme activities decreased after cadmium treatment. Furthermore, Western immunoblotting data revealed that glutathione peroxidase protein expression increased following cadmium exposure, but cytochrome P450 2E1 and 3A4 expressions were downregulated. However, pretreatment of rats with silymarin or garlic extract or both before cadmium administration was found to restore the protein expression of cytochrome P450 2E1 and 3A4, the level of free radicals, antioxidant enzymes, drug-metabolizing enzyme activities to their normal levels. Similarly, histological studies revealed that silymarin and/or garlic extract reduced the liver damage caused by cadmium. Silymarin and/or garlic extract reduced the adverse effects of cadmium on the activity of both drug-metabolizing and antioxidant enzymes activity. These antioxidants could be provided to those who work in cadmium-based sectors to help them cope with the adverse effects of cadmium on their kidneys. In addition, Inhibiting drug-metabolizing enzyme activity should be considered when administering therapeutic medications to persons exposed to cadmium because most therapeutic drugs and many endogenous substances are largely metabolized by these enzymes.",10.1007/s11356-023-30197-1

This study aimed to assess the suitability of P. elegans as a bioindicator of natural and anthropogenic marine pollution. Metal concentrations of aluminum (Al), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) were measured in shrimp collected from various sites in the Canary Islands, including areas affected by volcanic activity, industrial activity, and control zones. The determination of metal concentrations was conducted using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrophotometry (ICP-OES). The results showed significant differences in metal concentrations across the studied sites, with the highest levels of Al, Cu, Fe, Pb, and Zn observed in areas impacted by the Tajogaite volcanic eruption and harbor activity. Sites near old landfills and sewage pipes also exhibited elevated levels of Cd, Cu, and Pb, indicating strong anthropogenic influence. Al was found in the highest concentration in Harbour, reaching 25.7 ± 6.2 mg/kg, while the lowest concentration was observed in Control Lp at 11.5 ± 0.69 mg/kg. Conversely, lower metal concentrations were detected in control zones and areas with high dinoflagellate presence, suggesting a potential role of bioremediation by marine phytoplankton. The ability of P. elegans to accumulate metals in its tissues, particularly in areas of high pollution, highlights its potential as a bioindicator species. This study underscores the importance of P. elegans in monitoring marine pollution and provides insights into the environmental impact of both natural and human-induced contamination on coastal ecosystems.",10.1007/s11356-024-35207-4

Loss of Hemin-induced surface expression of GPVI was caused by shedding of the ectodomain of GPVI as verified by immunoblotting and is independent of the GPVI or CLEC-2 mediated ITAM (immunoreceptor-Tyrosine-based-activation-motif) signaling pathway as inhibitor studies revealed,Hemin,Tyrosine,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,The Subtilisin-Like Protease Furin Regulates Hemin-Dependent Ectodomain Shedding of Glycoprotein VI.,"INTRODUCTION
Hemolysis results in release of free hemoglobin and hemin liberation from erythrocytes. Hemin has been described to induce platelet activation and to trigger thrombosis.


METHODS
We evaluated the effect of hemin on platelet function and surface expression of the platelet collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI). Isolated platelets were stimulated with increasing concentrations of hemin.


RESULTS
We found that hemin strongly enhanced platelet activation, aggregation, and aggregate formation on immobilized collagen under flow. In contrast, we found that surface expression of GPVI was significantly reduced upon hemin stimulation with high hemin concentrations indicating that hemin-induced loss of surface GPVI does not hinder platelet aggregation. Loss of hemin-induced surface expression of GPVI was caused by shedding of the ectodomain of GPVI as verified by immunoblotting and is independent of the GPVI or CLEC-2 mediated ITAM (immunoreceptor-tyrosine-based-activation-motif) signaling pathway as inhibitor studies revealed. Hemin-induced GPVI shedding was independent of metalloproteinases such as ADAM10 or ADAM17, which were previously described to regulate GPVI degradation. Similarly, concentration-dependent shedding of CD62P was also induced by hemin. Unexpectedly, we found that the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase furin controls hemin-dependent GPVI shedding as shown by inhibitor studies using the specific furin inhibitors SSM3 and Hexa-D-arginine. In the presence of SSM3 and Hexa-D-arginine, hemin-associated GPVI degradation was substantially reduced. Further, SSM3 inhibited hemin-induced but not CRP-XL-induced platelet aggregation and thrombus formation, indicating that furin controls specifically hemin-associated platelet functions.


CONCLUSION
In summary, we describe a novel mechanism of hemin-dependent GPVI shedding and platelet function mediated by furin.",10.1055/s-0043-1768057
The extracellular portion of CD163 contains nine scavenger receptor Cysteine-rich (SRCR) and two Proline-serine-threonine (PST) domains,Cysteine,Proline,Component-Whole,component-whole,Genetically modified pigs lacking CD163 PSTII-domain-coding exon 13 are completely resistant to PRRSV infection.,"CD163 expressed on cell surface of porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) serves as a cellular entry receptor for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The extracellular portion of CD163 contains nine scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) and two proline-serine-threonine (PST) domains. Genomic editing of pigs to remove the entire CD163 or just the SRCR5 domain confers resistance to infection with both PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 viruses. By performing a mutational analysis of CD163, previous in vitro infection experiments showed resistance to PRRSV infection following deletion of exon 13 which encodes the first 12 amino acids of the 16 amino acid PSTII domain. These findings predicted that removal of exon 13 can be used as a strategy to produce gene-edited pigs fully resistant to PRRSV infection. In this study, to determine whether the deletion of exon 13 is sufficient to confer resistance of pigs to PRRSV infection, we produced pigs possessing a defined CD163 exon 13 deletion (ΔExon13 pigs) and evaluated their susceptibility to viral infection. Wild type (WT) and CD163 modified pigs, placed in the same room, were infected with PRRSV-2. The modified pigs remained PCR and serologically negative for PRRSV throughout the study; whereas the WT pigs supported PRRSV infection and showed PRRSV related pathology. Importantly, our data also suggested that removal of exon 13 did not affect the main physiological function associated with CD163 in vivo. These results demonstrate that a modification of CD163 through a precise deletion of exon 13 provides a strategy for protection against PRRSV infection.",10.1016/j.antiviral.2024.105793
"The most frequently identified NZBSE allergen was Benzalkonium chloride (contained in 48% of formulations), followed by Propylene glycol (6%), lanolin (4%), parabens (4%), caine anaesthetics (2%), neomycin sulphate (2%), and cetearyl alcohol (1%)",Benzalkonium,Propylene glycol,Component-Whole,component-whole,Allergens in ophthalmic medicaments in New Zealand.,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES
Eyelid allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) attributed to ophthalmic medications is often underreported, which can result in poor outcomes. Patch testing for eyelid ACD requires up-to-date knowledge of potential allergens. The aim of this study was to investigate allergens in ophthalmic medicaments in New Zealand.


METHODS
We conducted a cross-sectional review of ophthalmic medicaments available in New Zealand in October 2023. Prescription and over-the-counter products were catalogued with their respective ingredient lists according to product data sheets. Products unapproved for use as per Section 29 of the Medicines Act 1981, or that were unavailable for purchase were excluded. Ingredients were classified according to their function. Allergens in the New Zealand Baseline Series Extended (NZBSE) were recorded.


RESULTS
Seventy-three topical ophthalmic medicaments were identified with a total of 143 formulations (brands). Twenty-eight formulations were excluded, leaving a total of 67 topical medicaments (115 formulations) for analysis. Fifty-eight per cent of formulations contained at least one NZBSE allergen. The most frequently identified NZBSE allergen was benzalkonium chloride (contained in 48% of formulations), followed by propylene glycol (6%), lanolin (4%), parabens (4%), caine anaesthetics (2%), neomycin sulphate (2%), and cetearyl alcohol (1%).


CONCLUSIONS
The majority of ophthalmic preparations contain known allergens. Patch test series must be based on local data and revised regularly to ensure the diagnostic accuracy of patch testing. Patch testing patient's own products is imperative.",10.1111/ajd.14395
"Drug prevalences by LC-MS-MS were higher in urine for two drug classes (cocaine, Methadone) and higher in oral fluid for two drug classes (Buprenorphine, tramadol), but were equivalent in urine and oral fluid when averaged over all 10 drug classes",Methadone,Buprenorphine,Component-Whole,cause-effect,Comparing presumptive with direct-to-definitive drug testing in oral fluid vs. urine for a U.S. national sample of individuals misusing drugs.,"BACKGROUND
The aims are to compare the results of presumptive drug testing with confirmation of positives vs. direct-to-definitive drug testing, combined with investigation of urine vs. oral fluid as test matrices.


METHODS
Paired oral fluid and urine specimens were collected voluntarily and anonymously from 1098 individuals applying for methadone treatment in 11 clinics across 7 U.S. states. All specimens were analyzed by immunoassay (IA) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS).


RESULTS
Confirmed IA prevalences for urine were significantly higher than for oral fluid for 7 out of 10 drug classes - benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, methadone, opiates, oxycodone and tramadol. Drug prevalences by direct-to-definitive LC-MS-MS were either the same or higher than prevalences by confirmed IA. Drug prevalences by LC-MS-MS were higher in urine for two drug classes (cocaine, methadone) and higher in oral fluid for two drug classes (buprenorphine, tramadol), but were equivalent in urine and oral fluid when averaged over all 10 drug classes. Certain drugs of special concern such as heroin and buprenorphine were more frequently detected in oral fluid than urine.


CONCLUSIONS
Urine analysis showed some technical advantage over oral fluid in sensitivity to several drug classes within a confirmed IA testing protocol, but this may be outweighed if there is reason to believe that tampering with urine specimens is a significant problem. Overall drug detection by direct-to-definitive testing was similar for oral fluid and urine, but one matrix may be preferable if there is a particular drug of clinical or epidemiological interest.",10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2023.110894

However, nephrotoxicity is one of the dose-limiting factors in its treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the outcome of omega-3 nanoemulsion against colistin-induced nephrotoxicity and its possible underlying mechanism. Four rat groups were involved in the present research; each group containing ten rats was divided as follows: Group I (control) rats received normal saline; Group II (omega-3 nanoemulsion) rats received a dose of 500 mg/kg/body weight orally; Group III (colistin) rats received colistin intraperitoneally (300.000 IU/kg/day); and Group IV (colistin/omega-3 nanoemulsion) rats were treated for six days. The results revealed that colistin administration caused deterioration in renal functions such as creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, 24 h proteinuria, and kidney injury molecule-1 with decrease in creatinine clearance, resulting in histological alternation and tubular damage with diffuse interstitial inflammation. Additionally, colistin significantly increased the lipid peroxidation marker malonaldehyde, proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-1 beta. Also, autophagy influx marker microtubule-associated protein light chain 3B, Beclin-1, and necroptotic related proteins, receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK-3), RIPK-1, mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein, and autophagy pathway regulatory kinase AMP-activated protein kinase, with a decrease in antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase, and total antioxidant capacity, autophagic marker ubiquitin-binding protein (p62), and regulator Mammalian target of rapamycin. Interestingly, omega-3 nanoemulsion reversed the results above, dramatically improving renal function and histological picture. Thus, omega-3 nanoemulsion provided a notable method for suppressing colistin-induced nephrotoxicity via its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory power, inhibiting pathological autophagy and necroptosis.",10.1080/0886022X.2024.2429686

However, TAC and CAT showed a negative correlation between TOC and MDA. The intensity of gross and microscopic lesions was more in chromium (270 mg.kg-1) and arsenic (50 mg.kg-1) singly or in combination-treated groups. Thus, broiler chicks treated with chromium plus arsenic exhibited higher gross and microscopic lesion intensity than other treated groups. Fatty degeneration, severe cytoplasmic vacuolar degeneration, and expansion of sinusoidal spaces were the main lesions observed in the liver.

In here, young male mice were subjected to orchiectomy (ORC) to induce testosterone deprivation. Various techniques, including western blotting, immunofluorescence, Morris Water Maze, Golgi staining, and neuronal signal measurement, were used to evaluate the effects of sevoflurane on long-term (ORC 10 weeks) and short-term (ORC 2 weeks) testosterone deprivation, and assess whether testosterone (1 mg/kg 1 h before sevoflurane exposure) could mitigate sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity. Flutamide and anastrozole were administered to study testosterone's pathways of action. We found that sevoflurane increased tau phosphorylation and decreased the transient amplitude of Ca2+ signals and dendritic spine density in dorsal hippocampal CA1 (dCA1) neurons, leading to cognitive impairment in testosterone-deprived male mice. Testosterone treatment reversed the effects of sevoflurane in short-term testosterone-deprived male mice, but not in long-term testosterone-deprived male mice. Additionally, the neuroprotective effect of testosterone was blocked by flutamide rather than anastrozole. We have discovered for the first time that testosterone can mitigate the sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity in testosterone-deprived male mice and that there exists a therapeutic time window, which may be mediated by androgen receptors. This may provide new insights into the neuroprotective role of sex hormones.",10.1016/j.neuropharm.2024.110261
"In normoxic conditions, the majority of the ATP production (>95%) required for heart beating comes from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation of fatty acids (FAs) and glucose, with the remaining portion coming from a variety of sources, including Fructose, lactate, ketone bodies (KB) and branched chain amino acids (BCAA)",ATP,Fructose,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Molecular mechanisms of metabolic dysregulation in diabetic cardiomyopathy.,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), one of the most serious complications of diabetes mellitus, has become recognized as a cardiometabolic disease. In normoxic conditions, the majority of the ATP production (>95%) required for heart beating comes from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation of fatty acids (FAs) and glucose, with the remaining portion coming from a variety of sources, including fructose, lactate, ketone bodies (KB) and branched chain amino acids (BCAA). Increased FA intake and decreased utilization of glucose and lactic acid were observed in the diabetic hearts of animal models and diabetic patients. Moreover, the polyol pathway is activated, and fructose metabolism is enhanced. The use of ketones as energy sources in human diabetic hearts also increases significantly. Furthermore, elevated BCAA levels and impaired BCAA metabolism were observed in the hearts of diabetic mice and patients. The shift in energy substrate preference in diabetic hearts results in increased oxygen consumption and impaired oxidative phosphorylation, leading to diabetic cardiomyopathy. However, the precise mechanisms by which impaired myocardial metabolic alterations result in diabetes mellitus cardiac disease are not fully understood. Therefore, this review focuses on the molecular mechanisms involved in alterations of myocardial energy metabolism. It not only adds more molecular targets for the diagnosis and treatment, but also provides an experimental foundation for screening novel therapeutic agents for diabetic cardiomyopathy.",10.3389/fcvm.2024.1375400
Our results also highlight an unanticipated role of Ponatinib in causing direct activation of a kinase target despite its role as an ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor.,Ponatinib,ATP,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Integrated Stress Response Potentiates Ponatinib-Induced Cardiotoxicity.,"BACKGROUND
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a primary driver of cardiac contractile failure; yet, the cross talk between mitochondrial energetics and signaling regulation remains obscure. Ponatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia, is among the most cardiotoxic tyrosine kinase inhibitors and causes mitochondrial dysfunction. Whether ponatinib-induced mitochondrial dysfunction triggers the integrated stress response (ISR) to induce ponatinib-induced cardiotoxicity remains to be determined.


METHODS
Using human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes and a recently developed mouse model of ponatinib-induced cardiotoxicity, we performed proteomic analysis, molecular and biochemical assays to investigate the relationship between ponatinib-induced mitochondrial stress and ISR and their role in promoting ponatinib-induced cardiotoxicity.


RESULTS
Proteomic analysis revealed that ponatinib activated the ISR in cardiac cells. We identified GCN2 (general control nonderepressible 2) as the eIF2α (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α) kinase responsible for relaying mitochondrial stress signals to trigger the primary ISR effector-ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4), upon ponatinib exposure. Mechanistically, ponatinib treatment exerted inhibitory effects on ATP synthase activity and reduced its expression levels resulting in ATP deficits. Perturbed mitochondrial function resulting in ATP deficits then acts as a trigger of GCN2-mediated ISR activation, effects that were negated by nicotinamide mononucleotide, an NAD+ precursor, supplementation. Genetic inhibition of ATP synthase also activated GCN2. Interestingly, we showed that the decreased abundance of ATP also facilitated direct binding of ponatinib to GCN2, unexpectedly causing its activation most likely because of a conformational change in its structure. Importantly, administering an ISR inhibitor protected human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes against ponatinib. Ponatinib-treated mice also exhibited reduced cardiac function, effects that were attenuated upon systemic ISRIB administration. Importantly, ISRIB does not affect the antitumor effects of ponatinib in vitro.


CONCLUSIONS
Neutralizing ISR hyperactivation could prevent or reverse ponatinib-induced cardiotoxicity. The findings that compromised ATP production potentiates GCN2-mediated ISR activation have broad implications across various cardiac diseases. Our results also highlight an unanticipated role of ponatinib in causing direct activation of a kinase target despite its role as an ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor.",10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.123.323683

Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are at risk of complications from COVID-19. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) can reduce mortality from COVID-19 but is contraindicated in patients receiving calcineurin inhibitors (CI), which depend on cytochrome p4503A (CY3PA). In this study, we aim to show the feasibility of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir administration to SOT recipients receiving CI with coordination of medication management and limited tacrolimus trough monitoring.


METHODS
We reviewed adult SOT recipients treated with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir from 4/14 to 11/1/2022 and assessed for changes in tacrolimus trough and serum creatinine after therapy.


RESULTS
Of 47 patients identified, 28 were receiving tacrolimus and had follow-up laboratory testing. Patients had a mean age of 55 years, 17 (61%) received a kidney transplant and 23 (82%) received three or more doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. Patients had mild-moderate COVID-19 and started nirmatrelvir/ritonavir within 5 days of symptom onset. Median baseline tacrolimus trough concentration was 5.6 ng/mL (Interquartile range 5.1-6.7), while median follow-up tacrolimus trough concentration was 7.8 ng/mL (Interquartile range 5.7-11.5, p = 0.0017). Median baseline and follow-up serum creatinine levels were 1.21 mg/dL (Interquartile range 1.02-1.39) and 1.21 mg/dL (interquartile range 1.02-1.44, p = 0.3162), respectively. One kidney recipient had a follow up creatinine level >1.5 times baseline. No patients were hospitalized or died from COVID-19 in the follow up period.


CONCLUSION
While administration of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir resulted in a significant increase in tacrolimus concentration, this did not result in significant nephrotoxicity. Early oral antiviral treatment in SOT recipients is feasible with medication management, even with limited tacrolimus trough monitoring.",10.1111/tid.14037

It is found in every aspect of the environment such as the air, water, and soil. This pollutant affects both wild and domestic birds. Naringin has an active principle called flavonoid that has been found to have medicinal properties, mostly because of its antioxidant and metal chelating properties. This study was carried out to investigate the protective effect of naringin as an antioxidant against lead-induced anemia, cardio and nephrotoxicity, and hypertension. This study also aimed at elucidating the use of naringin as a heavy metal binder in poultry feed. Thirty-six cockerel chicks were used for this study, and randomly grouped into six groups per group; group A served as the control, group B received Pb-only (300 ppm), group C (Pb and naringin; 80 mg/kg), group D (Pb and naringin; 160 mg/kg), group E (naringin 80 mg/kg), and group F (naringin 160 mg/kg), respectively, for 8 weeks. Lead (Pb) was administered via drinking water, while naringin was administered via oral gavage. Lead acetate intoxication precipitated anemia as indicated by significant reductions in the values of PCV, RBC, and Hb concentration in lead-treated chicks when compared with the controls. Also, lead administration induced hypertension together with increased oxidative stress, depletion of the antioxidant defense system, reduced nitric oxide production, and an increase in high blood pressure. Immunohistochemistry indicated high expressions of cardiac troponin, renal angiotensin-converting enzymes, and renal neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin. Treatment with naringin corrected anemia, reduced oxidative stress, improved antioxidant system, reduced high blood pressure, and offered protection against lead acetate-induced cardio-renal dysfunction in cockerel chicks.

However, the protective effects of myricetin (MYC) and fisetin (FST), which are known to have potent antioxidant properties, against nephrotoxicity caused by exposure to lead acetate (LA), the water-soluble form of lead, have not been investigated. Our study investigated the protective role of these flavonoids against LA intoxication-induced nephrotoxicity. In our study, 42 male rats were used. The rats were randomly selected and divided into 6 groups. These groups were: control, LA (100 g/kg), LA + MYC (100 mg/kg), LA + MYC (200 mg/kg), LA + FST (100 mg/kg) and LA + FST (200 mg/kg). All chemicals were administered daily by gavage for 28 days. According to the experimental protocol, the animals were sacrificed and their kidney tissues were isolated. Serum biochemical parameters, histological examinations, levels of several trace elements, oxidative stress and inflammatory parameters at both biochemical and molecular levels in kidney tissues were examined. After LA administration, tissue lead levels increased and zinc levels decreased. This situation was reversed by MYC and FST treatment. Oxidative stress and inflammatory response were increased in the kidney tissue of LA-treated rats and renal function was impaired. It was observed that both doses of MYC and high dose of FST could prevent nephrotoxicity. Oral administration of both doses of MYC and high dose FST ameliorated the changes in biochemical, oxidative and inflammatory parameters. Restoration of normal renal tissue architecture was also demonstrated by histological studies. MYC and FST were found to have promising biological activity against LA-induced nephrotoxicity, acting by attenuating inflammation and oxidative stress and improving antioxidant status.",10.1007/s12011-023-03977-6

The first and second groups represent the positive (Clomiphene citrate 10 mg/kg) and negative (NaCl 0.9%) control groups, while the other groups received quercetin and ferulic acid at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg/day for 28 days. The sub-acute toxicity was monitored by examining the weights, biochemical parameters (AST, ALT, ALP, urea, and CREA), and histological changes in the kidneys and liver of the treated animals. Furthermore, the in vivo estrogenic effects were studied in terms of the serum and ovarian cholesterol levels, serum estradiol, and uterine proteins. Finally, Docking studies were conducted to evaluate the binding affinity of quercetin and ferulic acid for alpha and beta estrogen receptors. Results showed that both compounds were devoid of any signs of nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity. Additionally, quercetin and ferulic acid caused significant estrogenic effects evidenced by an increase of 8.7 to 22.48% in serum estradiol, though to a lesser amount than in the reference drug-treated group (64.21%). Moreover, the two compounds decreased the serum cholesterol levels (12.26-32.75%) as well as the ovarian cholesterol level (11.9% to 41.50%) compared to the negative control.

We found that HHcy worsening is most sensitive to other metabolic disorders. To identify metabolic genes and metabolites responsible for the worsening metabolic crosstalk, we examined mRNA levels of 324 metabolic genes in Hcy, glucose-related and lipid metabolic systems. We examined Hcy-metabolites (Hcy, SAH and SAM) by LS-ESI-MS/MS in 6 organs (heart, liver, brain, lung, spleen, and kidney) from C57BL/6J mice. Through linear regression analysis of Hcy-metabolites and metabolic gene mRNA levels, we discovered that SAH-responsive genes were responsible for most metabolic changes and all metabolic crosstalk mediated by Serine, Taurine, and G3P. SAH-responsive genes worsen glucose metabolism and cause upper glycolysis activation and lower glycolysis suppression, indicative of the accumulation of glucose/glycogen and G3P, Serine synthesis inhibition, and ATP depletion. Insufficient Serine due to negative correlation of PHGDH with SAH concentration may inhibit the folate cycle and transsulfurarion pathway and consequential reduced antioxidant power, including glutathione, taurine, NADPH, and NAD+. Additionally, we identified SAH-activated pathological TG loop as the consequence of increased fatty acid (FA) uptake, FA β-oxidation and Ac-CoA production along with lysosomal damage. We concluded that HHcy is most responsive to other metabolic changes in concomitant metabolic disorders and mediates worsening metabolic crosstalk mainly via SAH-responsive genes, that organ-specific Hcy metabolism determines organ-specific worsening metabolic reprogramming, and that SAH, acetyl-CoA, Serine and Taurine are critical metabolites mediating worsening metabolic crosstalk, redox disturbance, hypomethylation and hyperacetylation linking worsening metabolic reprogramming in metabolic syndrome.",10.1016/j.redox.2024.103139

"Blisters can be formed when Carbon dioxide, generated in the reaction with isocyanate and Water, is trapped in the film",Carbon dioxide,Water,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Novel Furfural-Derived Polyaldimines as Latent Hardeners for Polyurethane Adhesives.,"Moisture-curing one-component polyurethane systems in adhesive, sealant, and coating applications may show blister formation upon cure. Blisters can be formed when carbon dioxide, generated in the reaction with isocyanate and water, is trapped in the film. This problem can be mitigated by employing latent hardeners such as blocked polyamines, which are activated upon moisture exposure. The hydrolysis of the latent hardener yields the polyamine that quickly reacts with the isocyanate, forming urea linkages, and then chain extends the polymer. The hydrolysis also releases the blocking agent, which can potentially create an unpleasant odor. In this work, a series of di- and trifunctional aldimines were synthesized from commercially available polyamines, biobased hydroxymethyl furfural, and lauroyl chloride. Hydroxymethyl furfural was first esterified with lauroyl chloride and subsequently condensed with the polyamines to form the aldimines. The application of these novel aldimines in a model moisture-curing system allowed the preparation of blister- and odor-free castings. Based on our results, the mechanical performance of the different aldimines in casting and adhesive applications could be related to the polymer network density. This was dependent on the rate of the aldimine hydrolysis reaction to produce the polyamine. In particular, the use of aldimines prepared from polyether amines and 1,5-diamino-2-methylpentane showed excellent adhesive properties.",10.1021/acsami.3c17416

Time-dependent Cox regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratios.


Results
The risk of metabolic syndrome was significantly higher in night shift workers (hazard ratio = 1.45: 95% confidence interval = 1.36-1.54) and workers who were exposed to noise (1.15:1.07-1.24). Exposure to some other risk factors was also significantly associated with a higher risk of metabolic syndrome. They were dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, trichloroethylene, xylene, styrene, toluene, dichloromethane, copper, antimony, lead, copper, iron, welding fume, and manganese. Among the 28 significant pairs, 19 exhibited both positive additive and multiplicative effects.


Conclusions
Exposure to single or combined occupational risk factors may increase the risk of developing metabolic syndrome. Working conditions should be monitored and improved to reduce exposure to occupational hazards and prevent the development of the metabolic syndrome.",10.1016/j.shaw.2023.08.006
"RESULTS
Fructose consumption led to MS, reduced the levels of Tryptophan and 5-hydroxitryptophan, and increased histamine",Fructose,Tryptophan,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Fructose Consumption Alters Biogenic Amines Associated with Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors.,"BACKGROUND
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the major cause of mortality worldwide, whose most prominent risk factor is unhealthy eating habits, such as high fructose intake. Biogenic amines (BAs) perform important functions in the human body. However, the effect of fructose consumption on BA levels is still unclear, as is the association between these and CVD risk factors.


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to establish the association between BA levels and CVD risk factors in animals that consumed fructose.


METHODS
Male Wistar rats received standard chow (n=8) or standard chow + fructose in drinking water (30%) (n=8) over a 24-week period. At the end of this period, the nutritional and metabolic syndrome (MS) parameters and plasmatic BA levels were analyzed. A 5% level of significance was adopted.


RESULTS
Fructose consumption led to MS, reduced the levels of tryptophan and 5-hydroxitryptophan, and increased histamine. Tryptophan, histamine, and dopamine showed a correlation with metabolic syndrome parameters.


CONCLUSION
Fructose consumption alters BAs associated with CVD risk factors.",10.36660/abc.20220770
"BACKGROUND
Choline is an important metabolite involved in phospholipids synthesis, including serum lipids, and is the immediate precursor of Betaine",Choline,Betaine,Component-Whole,component-whole,"Dietary choline and betaine intake, cardio-metabolic risk factors and prevalence of metabolic syndrome among overweight and obese adults.","BACKGROUND
Choline is an important metabolite involved in phospholipids synthesis, including serum lipids, and is the immediate precursor of betaine. There are numerous studies with inconsistent results that evaluated the association between dietary choline intakes with cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, the association between dietary betaine and choline intakes with cardio-metabolic risk factors is not well studied. In the current study, our aim was to evaluate dietary choline and betaine intakes in the usual diet of obese individuals and to assess its association with serum lipids, blood pressure and glycemic markers among obese individuals.


METHODS
We recruited a total number of 359 obese people aged between 20 and 50 years in the present study. A semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used for dietary assessment; dietary choline and betaine intakes were calculated using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) database. National cholesterol education program adult treatment panel (NCEP-ATP)-III criteria was used metabolic syndrome (MetS) definition. Enzymatic methods were used to assess biochemical variables. Body composition was measured with the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) method.


RESULTS
Higher body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), fat-free mass (FFM) and basal metabolic rate (BMR) were observed in higher tertiles of dietary choline intake (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in terms of biochemical parameters among different tertiles of dietary choline intake, while systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were reduced in higher betaine tertiles (P < 0.05). For total dietary choline and betaine intakes, there was a reduction in DBP and low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations (P < 0.05). Also, a non-significant reduction in serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and MetS prevalence was observed in higher tertiles of dietary choline and betaine intakes. After classification of the study population according to MetS status, there was no significant difference in biochemical variables in subjects with MetS (P > 0.05), while in the non-MetS group, SBP, DBP, TG and insulin levels reduced in higher tertiles of dietary betaine and choline (P > 0.05).


CONCLUSION
According to our findings, higher dietary intakes of choline and betaine were associated with lower levels of blood pressure and LDL concentrations among obese individuals. Further studies are warranted to confirm the results of the current study.",10.1186/s12902-023-01323-4

The present narrative review aims to evaluate the existing evidence regarding the effectiveness of topiroxostat on renal function in patients with and without kidney disease. Materials and methods: A systematic search was conducted to identify relevant studies on renal function and topiroxostat published between 2005 and 2023. Various electronic databases were searched using different combinations of medical subject headings (MeSH) terms, and cross-referencing was performed. A total of 3146 articles were retrieved, and 18 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: The review included 18 studies investigating the effectiveness of topiroxostat on renal function in patients with and without kidney disease. Topiroxostat demonstrated maintenance of renal function, as evidenced by stable levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum creatinine, urinary albumin, and urinary protein. Furthermore, topiroxostat led to improvements in renal function, including increased eGFR and decreased levels of urinary albumin, uric acid, urinary protein, urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) following treatment. The literature also supports the safety profile of topiroxostat.

To investigate the effect of benzalkonium chloride (BAK)-preserved latanoprost and bimatoprost, polyquad (PQ)-preserved travoprost, and preservative-free (PF) latanoprost and tafluprost, all prostaglandin analogues (PGAs), on human conjunctival goblet cell (GC) survival. Furthermore, to investigate the effect of BAK-preserved and PF latanoprost on the cytokine secretion from GC.


METHODS
Primary human conjunctival GCs were cultivated from donor tissue. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and tetrazolium dye colorimetric (MTT) assays were used for the assessment of GC survival. A cytometric bead array was employed for measuring secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 from GC.


RESULTS
BAK-preserved latanoprost and bimatoprost reduced cell survival by 28% (p = 0.0133) and 20% (p = 0.0208), respectively, in the LDH assay compared to a negative control. BAK-preserved latanoprost reduced cell proliferation by 54% (p = 0.003), BAK-preserved bimatoprost by 45% (p = 0.006), PQ-preserved travoprost by 16% (p = 0.0041), and PF latanoprost by 19% (p = 0.0001), in the MTT assay compared to a negative control. Only PF tafluprost did not affect the GCs in either assay.

CONCLUSION
BAK-preserved PGA eye drops were more cytotoxic to GCs than PQ-preserved and PF PGA eye drops. BAK-preserved latanoprost induced an inflammatory response in GC. Treatment with PF and PQ-preserved PGA eye drops could mean better tolerability and adherence in glaucoma patients compared to treatment with BAK-preserved PGA eye drops.",10.1016/j.optom.2023.100481
"All observational studies which assessed the association of three heavy metals (Cadmium, mercury, lead) and bio-elements (Chromium, iron, manganese, and magnesium, copper) with the risk of MetS were included",Cadmium,Chromium,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Association of heavy metals and bio-elements blood level with metabolic syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.,"Background and objectives
The literature has reported heavy metals might alter the physiological and biochemical functions of body organs and cause several health problems. So, the present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association of blood levels of essential or non-essential metals with metabolic syndrome (MetS).


Methods
In this systematic review, some international databases including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched up to February 2024. All observational studies which assessed the association of three heavy metals (cadmium, mercury, lead) and bio-elements (chromium, iron, manganese, and magnesium, copper) with the risk of MetS were included. There was no limitation in the time of publication and language. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled effect sizes. Possible sources of heterogeneity were explored by meta-regression analysis.


Results
Totally, 29 studies were eligible for meta-analysis. Our results showed that increased level of cadmium (pooled OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.46) and mercury (pooled OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.38) significantly increased the risk of MetS. In contrast, increased level of chromium significantly reduced the risk of developing MetS (pooled OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.83). Moreover, association between lead, iron, copper, magnesium, and manganese with MetS was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). However, elevated lead levels in men increased the odds of MetS.


Conclusion
Our results show a significant association between blood levels of some heavy metals, including cadmium, mercury, and lead, with increased odds of MetS. On the other hand, chromium as a biometal decreased the odds of MetS.

"It has long been known that heterogeneous Chlorine (Cl) activation occurs on the polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs; liquid and solid particles containing Water, sulfuric acid, and in some cases nitric acid) that are found in the stratosphere, but these are only effective for ozone depletion chemistry at temperatures below about 195 K (i.e., largely in the polar regions during winter)",Chlorine,Water,Component-Whole,component-whole,Stratospheric chlorine processing after the 2020 Australian wildfires derived from satellite data.,"The 2019 to 2020 Australian summer wildfires injected an amount of organic gases and particles into the stratosphere unprecedented in the satellite record since 2002, causing large unexpected changes in HCl and ClONO2. These fires provided a novel opportunity to evaluate heterogeneous reactions on organic aerosols in the context of stratospheric chlorine and ozone depletion chemistry. It has long been known that heterogeneous chlorine (Cl) activation occurs on the polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs; liquid and solid particles containing water, sulfuric acid, and in some cases nitric acid) that are found in the stratosphere, but these are only effective for ozone depletion chemistry at temperatures below about 195 K (i.e., largely in the polar regions during winter). Here, we develop an approach to quantitatively assess atmospheric evidence for these reactions using satellite data for both the polar (65 to 90°S) and the midlatitude (40 to 55°S) regions. We show that heterogeneous reactions apparently even happened at temperatures at 220 K during austral autumn on the organic aerosols present in 2020 in both regions, in contrast to earlier years. Further, increased variability in HCl was also found after the wildfires, suggesting diverse chemical properties among the 2020 aerosols. We also confirm the expectation based upon laboratory studies that heterogeneous Cl activation has a strong dependence upon water vapor partial pressure and hence atmospheric altitude, becoming much faster close to the tropopause. Our analysis improves the understanding of heterogeneous reactions that are important for stratospheric ozone chemistry under both background and wildfire conditions.",10.1073/pnas.2213910120

However, the symbiosis has been frequently observed in hypoxic conditions continuing to pose an enigma. The present study has firstly characterized an electrically induced symbiosis primarily governed by Methylosarcina and Hyphomicrobium for the AME-D process in a hypoxic niche caused by Comammox Nitrospira. The kinetic analysis revealed that Comammox Nitrospira exhibited a higher apparent oxygen affinity compared to Methylosarcina. While the coexistence of comammox and AME-D resulted in an increase in methane oxidation and nitrogen loss rates, from 0.82 ± 0.10 to 1.72 ± 0.09 mmol CH4 d-1 and from 0.59 ± 0.04 to 1.30 ± 0.15 mmol N2 d-1, respectively. Furthermore, the constructed microbial fuel cells demonstrated a pronounced dependence of the biocurrents on AME-D due to oxygen competition, suggesting the involvement of direct interspecies electron transfer in the AME-D process under hypoxic conditions. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis revealed that Methylosarcina efficiently oxidized methane to formaldehyde, subsequently generating abundant NAD(P)H for nitrate reduction by Hyphomicrobium through the dissimilatory RuMP pathway, leading to CO2 production. This study challenges the conventional understanding of survival mechanism employed by AME-D symbionts, thereby contributing to the characterization responsible for limiting methane emissions and promoting nitrogen removal in hypoxic regions.",10.1016/j.watres.2024.121606

Aniline chosen as the best reductant for this aim has led to formation of composite (according to Raman spectroscopy) Prussian Blue - polyaniline nanoparticles. The protein-like size of the nanoparticles (∅ = 4 - 6 nm) has been confirmed by DLS and TEM imaging. Kinetic investigations of peroxidase-like activity in reversed micelles resulted in the catalytic rate constant belonging to the same size-dependence as regular bulk catalytically synthesized nanozymes (slope ≈ 2.6), allowing to denote the reported Prussian Blue nanoparticles synthesized in reversed micelles as nanozymes «artificial peroxidase». Hydrogen peroxide sensors made by dipping the suspension of the latter onto the electrode support, displayed two-fold higher sensitivity as compared to the Prussian Blue film-based ones.

Here, an all-dry process to transform electrochemically inert bulk WS2 into a multidomain electrochemical catalyst that enables scalable and cost-effective implementation of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water electrolysis is reported. Direct dry transfer of WS2 flakes to a gold thin film deposited on a silicon substrate provides a general platform to produce the working electrodes for HER with tunable charge transfer resistance. By treating the mechanically exfoliated WS2 with sequential Ar-O2 plasma, mixed domains of WS2, WO3, and tungsten oxysulfide form on the surfaces of the flakes, which gives rise to a superior HER with much greater long-term stability and steady-state activity compared to Pt.

"Detailed investigations revealed that endogenetic CDs within MF microspheres strongly construct covalent and Hydrogen-bonded interfacial connections, coupled with the protection provided by the microsphere shell, greatly suppressing nonradiative decay of CDs, resulting in a yellow or Orange RTP duration of about 7 s that is visible to the naked eye, even in aqueous or organic environments",Hydrogen,Orange,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Endogenetic Carbon Dot Strategy within Melamine-Formaldehyde Microspheres for Multifunctional Hybrid Fluorescence/Room-Temperature Phosphorescence Applications in Dry States and Aqueous Environments.,"Developing hybrid fluorescence (FL)/room-temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials in dry-state, aqueous, and organic solvents holds paramount importance in broadening their applications. However, it is extremely challenging due to dissolved oxygen and solvent-assisted relaxation causing RTP quenching in an aqueous environment and great dependence on SiO2-based materials. Herein, an efficient endogenetic carbon dot (CD) strategy within melamine-formaldehyde (MF) microspheres to activate RTP of CDs has been proposed through the pyrolysis of isophthalic acid (IPA) molecules and branched-chain intra-microspheres. The formation mechanism of CDs@MF from molecules to CDs with a branched chain of microspheres has been systematically studied. Detailed investigations revealed that endogenetic CDs within MF microspheres strongly construct covalent and hydrogen-bonded interfacial connections, coupled with the protection provided by the microsphere shell, greatly suppressing nonradiative decay of CDs, resulting in a yellow or orange RTP duration of about 7 s that is visible to the naked eye, even in aqueous or organic environments. Three samples glowed bright white and orange light stemming from hybrid FL/RTP dual-mode emission with a quantum yield of 29%-36% and were successfully applied to single CD-based white and orange LEDs with tunable color temperature.

"This study shows for the first time that Boric acid catalyses the hydrolysis of peroxyacids, resulting in an approximately 12-fold increase in hydrolysis rate for both Peracetic acid (PAA) and 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA) when 0.1 M boric acid is present",Boric acid,Peracetic acid,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Boric acid catalysed hydrolysis of peroxyacids.,"This study shows for the first time that boric acid catalyses the hydrolysis of peroxyacids, resulting in an approximately 12-fold increase in hydrolysis rate for both peracetic acid (PAA) and 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA) when 0.1 M boric acid is present. The maximum rate of hydrolysis occurs at pH 9 and pH 8.4 for PAA and MCPBA respectively. In contrast, carbonate buffer does not enhance the rate of PAA hydrolysis. The reaction was followed by measuring the initial rate of hydrogen peroxide formation using a specific Ti(iv) complexation method. The study of the hydrolysis reaction requires the presence of 2 × 10-5 M each of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid (EDTMP) in all solutions in order to chelate metal ions across the full pH range (3 to 13) that would otherwise contribute to peroxyacid decomposition. Catalysis of peroxyacid hydrolysis is most likely effected by the triganol boric acid acting as a Lewis acid catalyst, associating with the peroxide leaving group in the transition state to reduce the leaving group basicity. The products of the reaction are the well characterised monoperoxoborate species and the parent carboxylic acid. Analysis of the pH and borate dependence data reveals that in addition to a catalytic pathway involving a single boric acid molecule, there is a significant pathway involving either (a) two boric acid molecules or (b) the polyborate species, B3O3(OH)4 -. Knowledge about catalytic mechanisms for the loss of peroxyacids through hydrolysis is important because they are widely used in reagents in a range of oxidation, bleaching and disinfection applications.",10.1039/d3ra01046e

In this study the content of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the state of the glutathione system have been investigated in the oral fluid and gum tissues of adult male Wistar rats treated with thiram for 28 days during its administration with food at a dose of 1/50 LD50. Thiram induced formation of ROS in the oral cavity; this was accompanied by an imbalance in the ratio of reduced and oxidized forms of glutathione due to a decrease in glutathione and an increase in its oxidized form as compared to the control. Thiram administration caused an increase in the activity of glutathione-dependent enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase, and glutathione reductase). However, the time-course of enzyme activation in the gum tissues and oral fluid varied in dependence on the time of exposure to thiram. In the oral fluid of thiram-treated rats changes in the antioxidant glutathione system appeared earlier. The standard diet did not allow the glutathione pool to be fully restored to physiological levels after cessation of thiram intake.

Photothermal therapy (PTT) at mild temperature presents a promising alternative to traditional antibiotics due to its biological safety and ability to circumvent drug resistance. However, the efficacy of mild PTT is limited by bacterial thermotolerance. Herein, a nanocomposite, BP@Mn-NC, comprising black phosphorus nanosheets and a manganese-based nanozyme (Mn-NZ) is developed, which possesses both photothermal and catalytic properties. Mn-NZ imparts glucose oxidase- and peroxidase-like properties to BP@Mn-NC, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that induce lipid peroxidation and malondialdehyde accumulation across the bacterial cell membrane. This process disrupts unprotected respiratory chain complexes exposed on the bacterial cell membrane, leading to a reduction in the intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content. Consequently, mild PTT mediated by BP@Mn-NC effectively eliminates MDR infections by specifically impairing bacterial thermotolerance because of the dependence of bacterial heat shock proteins (HSPs) on ATP molecules for their proper functioning. This study paves the way for the development of a novel photothermal strategy to eradicate MDR pathogens, which targets bacterial HSPs through ROS-mediated inhibition of bacterial respiratory chain activity.",10.1002/advs.202303911

Cancer-triggered MnO2 degradation in the hydrogel, prompted by increased levels of glutathione (GSH) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2, leads to PD release and FL restoration, thereby controlling changes in the pore structure and increasing hydrogen bonding, resulting in physiologically visible alterations in mechanical stretchability, viscosity, swelling behavior, and adhesiveness. The pore size of the matrix increased from 21.83 to 36.81 m2/g upon GSH treatment, affecting the viscosity and swellability of the system. The resistance increased from 21.96 ± 1.16 to 30.69 ± 2.01 and 32.21 ± 2.54 kΩ, respectively, confirming the dependence of conductivity changes on H2O2 and GSH treatments. The in vitro treatment with cancer cells (HeLa, PC-3, and B16F10) facilitated a tunable electrochemical sensing performance via redox-mediated MnO2 breakdown by intracellular ROS and GSH, whereas hydrogels treated with normal cells (CHO-K1) showed minimal changes. Cancer-microenvironment-derived water-drop sensing showed three times higher response as compared to the normal cell-treated hydrogel.

"RESULTS
The AD process of three mesophilic semi-continuous 100L reactors critically intoxicated by free Ammonia (> 3.5 g_N L-1; inhibited hydrolysis and heterotrophic acetogenesis; interrupted methanogenesis) was restored by applying a strategy that included reducing pH using Acetic acid, washing out total ammonia with water, re-inoculation with active microbial flora and progressively re-introducing sugar beet pulp as a feed substrate",Ammonia,Acetic acid,Component-Whole,cause-effect,Potential of acetic acid to restore methane production in anaerobic reactors critically intoxicated by ammonia as evidenced by metabolic and microbial monitoring.,"BACKGROUND
Biogas and biomethane production from the on-farm anaerobic digestion (AD) of animal manure and agri-food wastes could play a key role in transforming Europe's energy system by mitigating its dependence on fossil fuels and tackling the climate crisis. Although ammonia is essential for microbial growth, it inhibits the AD process if present in high concentrations, especially under its free form, thus leading to economic losses. In this study, which includes both metabolic and microbial monitoring, we tested a strategy to restore substrate conversion to methane in AD reactors facing critical free ammonia intoxication.


RESULTS
The AD process of three mesophilic semi-continuous 100L reactors critically intoxicated by free ammonia (> 3.5 g_N L-1; inhibited hydrolysis and heterotrophic acetogenesis; interrupted methanogenesis) was restored by applying a strategy that included reducing pH using acetic acid, washing out total ammonia with water, re-inoculation with active microbial flora and progressively re-introducing sugar beet pulp as a feed substrate. After 5 weeks, two reactors restarted to hydrolyse the pulp and produced CH4 from the methylotrophic methanogenesis pathway. The acetoclastic pathway remained inhibited due to the transient dominance of a strictly methylotrophic methanogen (Candidatus Methanoplasma genus) to the detriment of Methanosarcina. Concomitantly, the third reactor, in which Methanosarcina remained dominant, produced CH4 from the acetoclastic pathway but faced hydrolysis inhibition. After 11 weeks, the hydrolysis, the acetoclastic pathway and possibly the hydrogenotrophic pathway were functional in all reactors. The methylotrophic pathway was no longer favoured. Although syntrophic propionate oxidation remained suboptimal, the final pulp to CH4 conversion ratio (0.41 ± 0.10 LN_CH4 g_VS-1) was analogous to the pulp biochemical methane potential (0.38 ± 0.03 LN_CH4 g_VS-1).


CONCLUSIONS
Despite an extreme free ammonia intoxication, the proposed process recovery strategy allowed CH4 production to be restored in three intoxicated reactors within 8 weeks, a period during which re-inoculation appeared to be crucial to sustain the process. Introducing acetic acid allowed substantial CH4 production during the recovery period. Furthermore, the initial pH reduction promoted ammonium capture in the slurry, which could allow the field application of the effluents produced by full-scale digesters recovering from ammonia intoxication.",10.1186/s13068-023-02438-5

Despite an extreme free ammonia intoxication, the proposed process recovery strategy allowed CH4 production to be restored in three intoxicated reactors within 8 weeks, a period during which re-inoculation appeared to be crucial to sustain the process. Introducing acetic acid allowed substantial CH4 production during the recovery period. Furthermore, the initial pH reduction promoted ammonium capture in the slurry, which could allow the field application of the effluents produced by full-scale digesters recovering from ammonia intoxication.",10.1186/s13068-023-02438-5

The latter could be a consequence of the former, as an increase in microbial cell synthesis offers an alternative hydrogen sink competing with methanogenesis. To test this assumption in live animals, we applied a saliva stimulant, pilocarpine, to modify liquid flow rate in cattle. Four non-lactating cows (750 ± 71 kg) were fed forage only (restricted to constant intake) in a 4 × 4 Latin square design with oral doses of 0, 1, 2.5 and 5mg pilocarpine/kg body weight and day. We quantified feed and water intake, ruminal and total tract mean retention time (MRT) of solute and particle markers, ruminal microbial yield (via urinary purine bases or metabolic faecal nitrogen), CH4 emission, digestibility, chewing behaviour, reticular motility and rumen fluid parameters. The effect of induced saliva flow was evident by visibly increased salivation and water intake. Increasing the pilocarpine dosages resulted in a linearly decreased MRT of fluid and small particles (p < 0.001 and p< 0.05, respectively) and methane yield as related to digested DM (p < 0.05), the latter at a magnitude of 5%. No effect of treatment was found on ruminal microbial yield estimated via purine derivates. Metabolic faecal N as an indicator of microbial growth linearly correlated with pilocarpine dosages (p < 0.05). No significant relationship was found between pilocarpine dosages and large particle MRT, nutrient digestibility, ruminal pH and short-chain fatty acids.

Hyperkalaemia is common, life-threatening and often requires emergency department (ED) management; however, no standardised ED treatment protocol exists. Common treatments transiently reducing serum potassium (K+) (including albuterol, glucose and insulin) may cause hypoglycaemia. We outline the design and rationale of the Patiromer Utility as an Adjunct Treatment in Patients Needing Urgent Hyperkalaemia Management (PLATINUM) study, which will be the largest ED randomised controlled hyperkalaemia trial ever performed, enabling assessment of a standardised approach to hyperkalaemia management, as well as establishing a new evaluation parameter (net clinical benefit) for acute hyperkalaemia treatment investigations.


METHODS AND ANALYSIS
PLATINUM is a Phase 4, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in participants who present to the ED at approximately 30 US sites. Approximately 300 adult participants with hyperkalaemia (K+ ≥5.8 mEq/L) will be enrolled. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to receive glucose (25 g intravenously <15 min before insulin), insulin (5 units intravenous bolus) and aerosolised albuterol (10 mg over 30 min), followed by a single oral dose of either 25.2 g patiromer or placebo, with a second dose of patiromer (8.4 g) or placebo after 24 hours. The primary endpoint is net clinical benefit, defined as the mean change in the number of additional interventions less the mean change in serum K+, at hour 6. Secondary endpoints are net clinical benefit at hour 4, proportion of participants without additional K+-related medical interventions, number of additional K+-related interventions and proportion of participants with sustained K+ reduction (K+ ≤5.5 mEq/L). Safety endpoints are the incidence of adverse events, and severity of changes in serum K+ and magnesium.


ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION
A central Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Ethics Committee provided protocol approval (#20201569), with subsequent approval by local IRBs at each site, and participants will provide written consent. Primary results will be published in peer-reviewed manuscripts promptly following study completion.

Therefore, it is crucial to develop novel antimicrobials that specifically target P. aeruginosa and its biofilms. In the present study, we determined that berberine hydrochloride inhibited the growth of planktonic bacteria as well as prevented the formation of biofilms. Moreover, we observed downregulation in the expression of pslA and pelA biofilm-related genes. Compared with existing antibiotics, berberine hydrochloride exhibits multiple modes of action against P. aeruginosa. Our findings suggest that berberine hydrochloride exerts its antimicrobial effects by damaging bacterial cell membranes, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), and reducing intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. Furthermore, berberine hydrochloride showed minimal cytotoxicity and reduced susceptibility to drug resistance. In a mouse model of peritonitis, it significantly inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa and exhibited a strong bacteriostatic action. In conclusion, berberine hydrochloride is a safe and effective antibacterial agent that inhibits the growth of P. aeruginosa.",10.1016/j.micpath.2024.106774

Tirzepatide belongs to a new class of anti-diabetic agents that stimulate both glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptors, resulting in a greater blood glucose-lowering effect and body weight reduction than glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs. However, data on the effects of switching from glucagon-like peptide-1 analogs to tirzepatide on the blood glucose level, body weight, and liver functions are unavailable.


Methods
Data from 40 patients with type 2 diabetes who received a prescription change from dulaglutide to tirzepatide were retrospectively analyzed at the 3 and 6 months after the switch. The analyzed data included glycosylated hemoglobin, body weight, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase levels, and fibrosis-4 index.


Results
Six months after the treatment switch, average reductions of 1.2% and 3.6 kg were observed in the glycosylated hemoglobin and body weight, respectively. The change in glycosylated hemoglobin level was negatively correlated with the baseline glycosylated hemoglobin level. However, body weight reduction was observed regardless of the baseline characteristics. Moreover, the aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase levels decreased 6 months after the switch. Reductions in alanine aminotransferase levels was greater in patients with higher baseline aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase levels. Although the fibrosis-4 index did not improve during the study period, a trend toward a decrease was observed in patients with a higher baseline fibrosis-4 index.


Conclusions
Switching from dulaglutide to tirzepatide has a beneficial effect on the blood glucose level, body weight, and liver function in patients with type 2 diabetes.",10.1007/s40200-024-01472-w

Diabetes mellitus (DM) may have different adverse effects on the male reproductive system. Zinc (Zn) is one of the necessary elements in the human and mammalian diet that plays an important role in scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) by providing antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties. The aim of this study was to determine the protective effects of zinc supplements on sperm chromatin and the evaluation of sperm deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) integrity in diabetic men.


Methods
In this interventional study, 43 infertile Iranian men in diabetic and non-diabetic groups were included. They were then randomly divided into two subgroups: normal saline intake and zinc sulfate intake (25 mg orally for 64 days each). Different indices of sperm analysis (number, morphology and motility) and testosterone levels were evaluated in four groups. Protamine deficiency and DNA fragmentation were assessed using chromomycin A3 (CMA3) and sperm chromatin dispersion (SCD) methods, respectively.


Results
Zinc supplementation reduced the deformity of neck and head of sperms (p < 0.05), as well as deformity of sperm tail in infertile diabetic men. Zinc administration ameliorated sperm motility types A, B and C (p < 0.05). Moreover, zinc administration reduced abnormal morphology and DNA fragmentation of sperms, which increased the SCD1 and SCD2 and reduced the SCD3 and SCD4 in both treated groups.


Conclusion
Zinc supplementation, as a powerful complement, is able to balance the effect of diabetes on sperm parameters, sperm chromatin and DNA integrity. Consequently, zinc supplementation can probably be considered a supportive compound in the diet of diabetic infertile men.",10.1007/s13224-023-01767-7

GC-MS analysis of the seed oil revealed 20 compounds, with octadecane (52.2-55.4%) as the major constituent, and the fatty acid analysis revealed 17 fatty acids, with oleic acid (42.3-43.1%) as the main constituent, followed by lauric acid (19.8-20.3%). The antimicrobial activity of date seed oil was determined using the microdilution method. A significant inhibition against gram-negative bacteria was noted in microbiological media and UHT milk, with a log reduction ranging from 4.3 to 6.7 (at 37 °C/24 h) and 5.7 to 7.2 (at 10 °C/7 days), respectively, at oil concentrations ranging between 10 and 15 µl/ml.

In this paper, we propose a rapid and effective method that uses 3D printing, ceramic casting, and the incorporation of mesh reinforcement to create load-bearing bone grafts with patient-specific three-dimensional geometry. Using two types of facial bones as examples, we show that this fabrication method has a high degree of geometrical fidelity. We also experimentally study the fracture behavior of six different architectures designed for the treatment of mandibular defects, one of the principal load-bearing facial bones. These design configurations include un-reinforced calcium sulfate samples, and samples reinforced with one or two layers of stainless steel, poly (lactic acid), and poly (L-lactic acid). The results suggested a trade-off between energy dissipation and maximum load based on the position of the metal mesh in the sample. Samples reinforced with one layer of metallic mesh at their lowermost margin exhibited a 17% higher stiffness and a 21.3% higher peak load, while samples with a layer of metal mesh embedded within dissipated 16% more energy. Samples with two layers of metallic mesh demonstrated the highest improvements among all samples, dissipating 5767.85% more energy and exhibiting a peak load 145.6% higher compared to plain CS. The improvements in stiffness for SD, SL, and S2 were 3%, 21.3%, and 21.9% respectively compared to the plain ceramic. In contrast, PLA mesh improved energy dissipation by 96.71% but reduced the peak load by 29.18%, while PLLA mesh decreased both the peak load and the dissipated energy by 13.05% and 35.31%, respectively.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent predictor of mortality for HF. The increase in prevalence, co-morbidity and hospitalization rates of both DM and HF has further fueled the possibility of overlapping disease pathology between the two. For decades, antidiabetic drugs that are known to definitively increase the risk of HF are the thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and saxagliptin in the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and insulin, which causes sodium and water retention, and whether metformin is effective or safe for HF is not clear. Notably, sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and partial glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) all achieved positive results for HF endpoints, with SGLT2 inhibitors in particular significantly reducing the composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization for heart failure (HHF). Further understanding of the mutual pathophysiological mechanisms between HF and DM may facilitate the detection of novel therapeutic targets to improve the clinical outcome. This review focuses on the association between HF and DM, emphasizing the efficacy and safety of antidiabetic drugs and HF treatment.

"Conclusion
Oral premedication with Melatonin 6mg administered two hours before surgery significantly reduced MAP before and after induction of GA with a significant reduction in dose of Propofol requirement",Melatonin,Propofol,Component-Whole,cause-effect,"Effects of oral melatonin premedication on hemodynamic responses to intubation, anesthetic requirements and postoperative sedation: A randomized trial.","Background and Aims
Sedative effects of melatonin may have an additive effect on general anesthesia (GA). We compared hemodynamic response to intubation following oral premedication with melatonin versus placebo. Induction dose of propofol, isoflurane and fentanyl consumption were also compared.


Material and Methods
This prospective, double-blinded study was conducted in fifty patients randomized into two equal groups. Group M received oral melatonin 6 mg and group P a placebo two hours before surgery. All patients were induced with intravenous propofol of 1.5-2.5mg/kg till loss of response to verbal commands, three minutes after vecuronium, laryngoscopy was done and trachea was intubated. Heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressures (MAP) were recorded before premedication, before induction, immediately after induction and then at 1,3,5 and 10 minutes after intubation.


Results
Mean HR was comparable in both groups throughout the study period. Group M had significantly lower MAP before induction and immediately after induction (P < 0.05). At all other time points MAP remained comparable in both groups. Mean isoflurane consumption was significantly lower in group M compared to group P (14.8 ± 4.2 vs 19.7 ± 3.2 mL). Propofol requirement for induction was also significantly lower in group M (102.4 ± 19.6 vs 122.4 ± 26.3mg). Intraoperative fentanyl consumption was comparable.


Conclusion
Oral premedication with melatonin 6mg administered two hours before surgery significantly reduced MAP before and after induction of GA with a significant reduction in dose of propofol requirement. Titrating induction dose of propofol till loss of response to verbal commands did not effectively attenuate responses to laryngoscopy and intubation following melatonin oral premedication.",10.4103/joacp.joacp_159_22
"Desflurane resulted in a 65% relative reduction in the incidence of prolonged extubation compared with Sevoflurane (95% confidence interval 49% to 76%, P < .0001) and in a 78% relative reduction compared with isoflurane (58% to 89%, P = .0001)",Desflurane,Sevoflurane,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Systematic review with meta-analysis of relative risk of prolonged times to tracheal extubation with desflurane versus sevoflurane or isoflurane.,"The objective of this systematic review was to estimate the relative risk of prolonged times to tracheal extubation with desflurane versus sevoflurane or isoflurane. Prolonged times are defined as ≥15 min from end of surgery (or anesthetic discontinuation) to extubation in the operating room. They are associated with reintubations, naloxone and flumazenil administration, longer times from procedure end to operating room exit, greater differences between actual and scheduled operating room times, longer times from operating room exit to next case start, longer durations of the workday, and more operating room personnel idle while waiting for extubation. Published randomized clinical trials of humans were included. Generalized pivotal methods were used to estimate the relative risk of prolonged extubation for each study from reported means and standard deviations of extubation times. The relative risks were combined using DerSimonian-Laird random effects meta-analysis with Knapp-Hartung adjustment. From 67 papers, there were 78 two-drug comparisons, including 5167 patients. Studies were of high quality (23/78) or moderate quality (55/78), the latter due to lack of blinding of observers to group assignment and/or patient attrition because patients were extubated after operating room exit. Desflurane resulted in a 65% relative reduction in the incidence of prolonged extubation compared with sevoflurane (95% confidence interval 49% to 76%, P < .0001) and in a 78% relative reduction compared with isoflurane (58% to 89%, P = .0001). There were no significant associations between studies' relative risks and quality, industry funding, or year of publication (all six meta-regressions P ≥ .35). In conclusion, when emergence from general anesthesia with different drugs are compared with sevoflurane or isoflurane, suitable benchmarks quantifying rapidity of emergence are reductions in the incidence of prolonged extubation achieved by desflurane, approximately 65% and 78%, respectively. These estimates give realistic context for interpretation of results of future studies that compare new anesthetic agents to current anesthetics.",10.1016/j.jclinane.2023.111210

This was achieved by using acryloyl derivatives of natural α-amino acids, specifically ornithine and cystine. The δ-amino group of ornithine was modified with an acryloyl group to facilitate its attachment to the polymer chain. Additionally, N,N'-bisacryloylcystine, derived from cystine, was employed as the cross-linker. The hydrogel was obtained through a process of free radical polymerization. This hydrogel, composed only from derivatives of natural amino acids, has proven to be a competitive sorbent and has been effectively used to remove heavy metal pollutants, mainly lead, copper, and silver ions, from aqueous media. The maximum sorption capacities were ca. 155 mg·g-1, 90 mg·g-1, and 215 mg·g-1, respectively for Pb(II), Cu(II), and Ag(I). The material was characterized by effective regeneration, maintaining the sorption capacity at around 80%, 85%, and 90% for Cu(II), Ag(I), and Pb(II), respectively, even after five cycles. The properties of sorption materials, such as sorption kinetics and the effect of pH on sorption, as well as the influence of the concentration of the examined metal ions on the swelling ratio and morphology of the gel, were investigated. The EDS technique was employed to investigate the composition and element distribution in the dry gel samples. Additionally, IR spectroscopy was used to identify the functional groups responsible for binding the studied metal ions, providing insights into their specific interactions with the hydrogel.",10.3390/gels10090560

Generally, higher trypanocidal activities of salinomycin derivatives are associated with higher cell swelling activities. Although ironomycin (C20-propargylamine derivative of salinomycin) and salinomycin showed identical cell swelling activities, ironomycin was 6 times more trypanocidal than salinomycin, and the 50% growth inhibition (GI50) values were 0.034 μM and 0.20 μM, respectively.

Based on our first finding that the neuron viability was improved as the lysine on the gelatin was converted into a guanidine structure, a three-dimensional (3D) gelatin hydrogel composed of gelatin and poly(allylguanidine) (PAG) was prepared to investigate neural cell behaviors. As expected, improved neuron viability, neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and inhibited glial cell growth were simultaneously observed in the gelatin cross-linked with the PAG hydrogel (G-PAG) but not in the gelatin hydrogel cross-linked with poly-d-lysine (PDL) or polyethylenimine (PEI). In addition, in vivo tests also illustrated that G-PAG could provide an environment for neural culture, with improving neuron viability and neurite outgrowth. Several hydrogel characteristics-including the swelling ratio, mechanical strength, and electric property-that theoretically can influence neural cell response showed no significant difference among them. Therefore, the guanidine structure of PAG was proposed to determine the behaviors of neural cells within the gelatin-polycation hydrogels, and we proposed that the neural cell behavior is regulated by a specific gelatin-neuron relationship. The information found in this study provides a concept to design and modify gelatin-based hydrogels for neural tissue engineering applications.",10.1021/acsomega.3c03769

For these reasons, they are common organic contaminants in raw wastewater. The purpose of the presented studies was to compare the adsorption capacity of three carbon-silica composites - metal-free C/SiO2, iron-enriched C/Fe/SiO2 and manganese-enriched C/Mn/SiO2 towards diclofenac. The studies were carried out in single, and mixed systems in the presence of poly(acrylic acid) polymer. Adsorption, desorption and kinetics of the adsorption process were investigated. The concentration of diclofenac in the supernatants was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. The solids were also characterized with an ASAP apparatus using low-temperature nitrogen desorption adsorption isotherms at liquid nitrogen temperature. In addition, potentiometric titrations and electrophoretic mobility measurements, as well as stability tests of the studied suspensions were carried out. The most efficient composite among investigated ones proved to be C/Fe/SiO2 removing diclofenac at the level of 46.68 mg/g for its initial concentration of 90 ppm.

These crosslinking starch films were then used to create pH-sensitive food labels using a casting method. Blueberry anthocyanins were incorporated into these smart labels as a pH-sensitive colorimetric sensor. The mechanical properties, moisture resistance, and pH responsiveness of these smart labels were then examined. Crosslinking improved the mechanical properties and pH sensitivity of the labels. These different crosslinking agents also affected the hydrophobicity of the labels to varying degrees.

Garlic protein is one of the main components of garlic. It has several beneficial characteristics. This study aimed to characterize a double crosslinked hydrogel formed with alginate, calcium ions (Ca2+), and garlic protein hydrolysates (GPH), and to develop hydrogel beads for targeted delivery of bioactive constituents to the gastrointestinal tract.


RESULTS
The results indicated that the degree of GPH hydrolysis was approximately 3% following trypsin treatment. The inner structure of the double crosslinked hydrogel showed a honeycomb pattern, with solid-like gel rheology and improved texture properties at a 4% (w/v) GPH concentration. The GPH-based hydrogel beads demonstrated pH sensitivity, swelling in near-neutral and alkaline environments, and the encapsulated paclitaxel (PTX) exhibited an amorphous phase with preferential release in intestinal conditions. The GPH group also achieved greater drug encapsulation efficiency than a soy protein hydrolysate (SPH) group, and proteomic analysis suggested that lower molecular weight and peptide charge favored the formation of peptide-integrated double crosslinking hydrogels.

The stability against osmotic pressure, encapsulation efficiency and in vitro release profiles of both water- and oil-soluble bioactives were investigated. The presence of interfacial crystallized DAG shells increased the emulsion stability by reducing the swelling and shrinkage of emulsions against osmotic pressure and heating treatment. DAG crystals located at the inner water/oil (W1/O) interface and the gelation of the inner phase by gelatin helped reduce the oil droplet size and slow down the salt release rate. The DAG and gelatin-contained double emulsion showed improved encapsulation efficiency of bioactives, especially for the epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) during storage. The double emulsions with DAG had a lower digestion rate but higher bioaccessibility of EGCG and curcumin after in vitro digestion.

In addition, the hydrophilic gelatin (GT) containing thymol (THY) was fabricated as GT/THY layer to contact connective tissue, potentially for bacterial gathering. Due to the different chemical nature and weak cohesion of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic layers, hybrid fibers made of PLA/SIM and GT/THY were electrospun as cohesion promoters between these layers. The microstructure and characteristics of the synthesized multilayer substrate, named GT/PLA, were evaluated, and different fibrous monolayers were fabricated to determine the optimal concentrations of drugs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed continuous, smooth, randomly aligned, and bead-free fibers. In addition, there were no drug particles on the fiber surfaces which displayed the good placement of those inside the fibers. The mats exhibited satisfactory tensile strength (4.60 ± 0.14 MPa) and favorable physicochemical properties, including proper porosity percentage (<50 %) and appropriate pore size. Suitable swelling behavior (293 ± 0.05 %) and adequate degradation rates were also approved by characterizing swelling and degradability in vitro.

In this study, the hygrothermal aging behaviour of injection-molded SC-PLA and SC-PLA/microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) composites at different temperatures (25 °C and 60 °C) was investigated from micro- and macroscopic perspectives. The results demonstrated that the hydrolysis of SC-PLA was sequentially dominated by the amorphous region, the homogeneous crystalline region, the stereo-complexed crystalline region (three stages). The hydrolytic degradation of SC-PLA only completed the first stage after 4 weeks aging at 25 °C, while it was in the third stage after 4 weeks aging at 60 °C. On this basis, the accelerating effect of 10 wt% MCC on the hydrolysis process of SC-PLA at different stages was investigated. It was found that MCC shortened the hydrolysis time in the stereo-complexed crystalline region by reducing the rearrangement of amorphous structure to form SC and causing cracks and interfacial deterioration by water absorption-swelling-degradation. In addition, the thermal properties and impact strength of SC-PLA and SC-PLA/MCC composites decreased dramatically due to rapid hydrolytic degradation at 60 °C.

A higher quantity of amino acids considerably (p < 0.05) inhibited the ability of starch-amino acid blends to expand their solubility index and swelling capacity. The addition of amino acids also significantly decreased peak viscosity (952.33-540.67 cP), hot paste viscosity (917-528 cP), cold paste viscosity (1209.67-659 cP), and setback (277.67-131 cP) of WS. Addition of amino acids enhanced the stability ratio (SR) of WS. All the studied samples displayed storage moduli (G') values higher than loss moduli (G'') but rheologically weak gel characteristics. Molecular dynamics simulation studies revealed that interactions between amino acids and water greatly reduced the number of starch-water hydrogen bonds while preserving a higher number of starch-starch intramolecular interactions.

In addition to gluten proteins, starch impacts the quality characteristics of the final baked product. Wheat starch consists of amylose and amylopectin organized into alternating semicrystalline and amorphous layers in granules that vary in size and are embedded in the endosperm protein matrix. Investigation of the molecular movement of protons in the dough system provides a comprehensive insight into granular swelling and amylose leaching. Starch interacts with water, proteins, amylase, lipids, yeast, and salt during various stages of breadmaking. As a result, the starch polymers within the produced crumb and crust, together with the rate of retrogradation and staling due to structural reorganization, moisture migration, storage temperature, and relative humidity determines the final product's textural perception. This review aims to provide insight into wheat starch composition and functionality and critically review recently published research results with reference to starch structure-function relationship and factors affecting it during dough formation, fermentation, baking, cooling, and storage of bread.",10.1111/1541-4337.13147

Fermentation with Lactobacillus plantarum over 48 h resulted in significant changes. Protein content decreased substantially in both varieties, especially in SF, and amylose content increased. Swelling power and solubility also increased more in SF. The gel hardness of fermented SF increased by approximately 22 %, whereas HF showed minimal change. These differences are due to variations in granule rigidity and starch molecule leaching. SF granules maintained rigidity and a robust external network due to higher amylose leaching. In contrast, the lower initial rigidity and higher amylopectin leaching in HF hindered strong gel network formation. These findings offer insights into the structural and molecular mechanisms of rice fermentation with lactic acid bacteria.",10.1016/j.foodchem.2024.141615
"The competition for water molecules between the OG and Rice starch resulted in partial swelling of the starch granules, consequently reducing particle size, lowering Amylose leaching, and decreasing the proportion of short-amylose chains",Rice,Amylose,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Effects of oat β-glucan on the retrogradation behavior of rice starch and its potential mechanism.,"In this study, to minimize the quality deterioration caused by the retrogradation of starch-based food, the effect and mechanism of oat β-glucan (OG) on the retrogradation of rice starch was investigated. OG effectively decreased storage modulus (G'), syneresis, and retrogradation enthalpy, indicating the inhibition of short-term and long-term retrogradation of rice starch. The competition for water molecules between the OG and rice starch resulted in partial swelling of the starch granules, consequently reducing particle size, lowering amylose leaching, and decreasing the proportion of short-amylose chains. The microstructure characterization showed that the OG-treated rice starch group (ST-OG) exhibited a smoother and denser surface. Particularly, no notable alterations were observed in the structure of the ST-OG sample during storage, owing to the improved water-holding capacity of starch gel and reduced proportion of free water caused by OG. Furthermore, the ordered structure results confirmed the occurrence of hydrogen bonding between OG and rice starch, which hindered the rearrangement of starch molecules.

Additionally, reductions were observed in antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH). In addition, testosterone level decreased and signs of testicular damage were observed in the MTX group. Conversely, in the group treated with diosgenin alongside MTX at a dosage of 50 mg/kg, there was a significant decrease in oxidative stress markers (MDA, ROS, nitrite) and inflammatory markers (TNFα and IL-6). Moreover, there was a significant increase in the levels of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GSH).

Candida species are frequently isolated from the oral cavity of patients with cystic fibrosis. However, the information on the role of Candida in cystic fibrosis is scarce.


AIMS
This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence, virulence profile and antifungal susceptibility of oral isolates of Candida albicans recovered from patients with cystic fibrosis.


METHODS
Oropharyngeal swab samples were collected from sixty-five cystic fibrosis patients and sixty-five healthy individuals. Candida isolates were identified by MALDI-TOF VITEK-MS. Proteinase, phospholipase and esterase activity, biofilm production and level expression of ALS, SAP and PLB genes in C. albicans were evaluated. Minimal inhibitory concentration values were determined by means of an antifungal susceptibility test.


RESULTS
Oral Candida colonization in cystic fibrosis patients was 66.15%, while in healthy individuals was 36.92%. C. albicans was the most frequently isolated species. C. albicans strains from cystic fibrosis patients were high producers of protease and biofilm, and had higher expression levels of adhesin and protease-associated genes in comparison with healthy subjects. Among the C. albicans strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients, 18.91% were resistant to itraconazole, while 16.21% exhibited resistance to ketoconazole and fluconazole, and only one strain was resistant to voriconazole.

It is caused by loss of function variants of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a membrane protein located on the apical side of epithelial cells. The most prevalent CF-causing mutation, the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del), is characterized by folding and trafficking defects, resulting in the decreased functional expression of the protein on the plasma membrane. Two classes of small-molecule modulators, termed potentiators and correctors, respectively, have been developed to rescue either the gating or the cellular processing of defective F508del CFTR. Kaftrio, a next-generation triple-combination drug, consisting of the potentiator ivacaftor (VX770) and the two correctors tezacaftor (VX661) and elexacaftor (VX445), has been demonstrated to be a life-changing therapeutic modality for the majority of people with CF worldwide. While the mechanism of action of VX770 and VX661 is almost known, the precise mechanism of action and binding site of VX445 have not been conclusively determined. We investigated the activity of VX445 on mutant F508del to identify the protein domains whose expression is mostly affected by this corrector and to disclose its mechanisms of action. Our biochemical analyses revealed that VX445 specifically improves the expression and the maturation of MSD2, heterologously expressed in HEK 293 cells, and confirmed that its effect on the functional expression of defective F508del CFTR is additive either with type I or type II CFTR correctors. We are confident that our study will help to make a step forward in the comprehension of the etiopathology of the CF disease, as well as to give new information for the development and testing of combinations of even more effective correctors able to target mutation-specific defects of the CFTR protein.",10.3390/ijms241612838

PA colonizes the lung where it adapts to the local environment, and/or to treatments by drugs. This genotypic and phenotypic adaptation, in turns, influences its interaction with its environment, like bacteria from the microbiota. As an example, to access iron, PA produces and secretes two siderophores, pyoverdine and pyochelin that are iron chelators scavenging iron from the environment and bringing it back into the bacterial cells. Siderophores production depends on the level of iron starvation, on the presence of other bacteria, etc. this latter component being less well investigated. Even if studies on bacterial interactions, and their evolution, have been increasing since several years, we are still facing a lack of tools, for example, to specifically follow the growth of PA isolates in such competitive environments. We thus improved a cloning method to gain time in the cloning steps, to lower the polar effects, and to accurately follow the interactions of any PA isolate with other bacteria. For that, a fluorescent reporter gene was inserted between two genes, the glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase (glmS) and PA5548. This reporter was efficiently produced either from an inducible or a house-keeping promoter, and its expression did not lead to polar effects. We used this strain to study intra and inter-specific bacterial competitions for iron between different lung pathogens. We thus grew wild-type PA together either with an isogenic PA ΔpvdS variant, that does not produce the most efficient siderophore pyoverdine, or with Klebsiella pneumoniae or Acinetobacter baumanii, two other lung pathogens. We finally monitored the effect of the loss of pvdS on the competition between PA and the other bacterial species. These studies enabled us to differentiate intra from inter specific competitions, both arising in the lung environment, and pinpoint the importance of the bacterial specie for the adaptation of pyoverdine production.",10.1016/j.mimet.2023.106753

The action of tris(1,10-phenanthroline) ruthenium (II) bis(hexafluorophosphate) (RuPhen3) encapsulated in PEG114-block-PLAx micelles and vesicles was shown to result in an appreciable aPDT inactivation efficiency against planktonic Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In particular, the encapsulation of the PS, its release, and the efficiency of singlet oxygen (1O2) generation upon irradiation with blue light were studied spectroscopically. The antimicrobial effect was analyzed with two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Compared with PS-loaded micelles, formulations of the PS-loaded vesicles showed 10 times enhanced activity with a strong photodynamic inactivation effect of at least a 4.7 log reduction against both a Pseudomonas aeruginosa lab strain and a clinical isolate collected from the lung of a cystic fibrosis (CF) patient.

SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitors (SGLT2i) can protect the kidneys and heart, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood.


METHODS
To gain insights on primary effects of SGLT2i that are not confounded by pathophysiologic processes or are secondary to improvement by SGLT2i, we performed an in-depth proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and metabolomics analysis by integrating signatures from multiple metabolic organs and body fluids after 1 week of SGLT2i treatment of nondiabetic as well as diabetic mice with early and uncomplicated hyperglycemia.


RESULTS
Kidneys of nondiabetic mice reacted most strongly to SGLT2i in terms of proteomic reconfiguration, including evidence for less early proximal tubule glucotoxicity and a broad downregulation of the apical uptake transport machinery (including sodium, glucose, urate, purine bases, and amino acids), supported by mouse and human SGLT2 interactome studies. SGLT2i affected heart and liver signaling, but more reactive organs included the white adipose tissue, showing more lipolysis, and, particularly, the gut microbiome, with a lower relative abundance of bacteria taxa capable of fermenting phenylalanine and tryptophan to cardiovascular uremic toxins, resulting in lower plasma levels of these compounds (including p-cresol sulfate). SGLT2i was detectable in murine stool samples and its addition to human stool microbiota fermentation recapitulated some murine microbiome findings, suggesting direct inhibition of fermentation of aromatic amino acids and tryptophan. In mice lacking SGLT2 and in patients with decompensated heart failure or diabetes, the SGLT2i likewise reduced circulating p-cresol sulfate, and p-cresol impaired contractility and rhythm in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived engineered heart tissue.


CONCLUSIONS
SGLT2i reduced microbiome formation of uremic toxins such as p-cresol sulfate and thereby their body exposure and need for renal detoxification, which, combined with direct kidney effects of SGLT2i, including less proximal tubule glucotoxicity and a broad downregulation of apical transporters (including sodium, amino acid, and urate uptake), provides a metabolic foundation for kidney and cardiovascular protection.",10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.065517

This study was carried out to explore the antidiabetic, antioxidative and antihyperlipidemic potential of strawberry extracts against alloxan-induced (100 mg/kg body weight) diabetic rats. Accordingly, rats were categorized into six groups including control (G0), positive control (G1), treatment groups (G2, G3, and G4) given strawberry extract at 250, 500, and 750 mg/kg of body weight, respectively, and G5 provided metformin @70 mg/kg BW for 28 days with ad libitum diet. At the trial termination, the rats were sacrificed and were subjected to analysis including body weight, blood glucose level and glycemic indicators, antioxidant parameters, lipid profile, renal function test (RFT), liver function test (LFT) and histopathology for pancreatic tissues. The results indicated that treatment of diabetic rats with strawberry extract at 500 mg/kg body weight (BW) resulted in significant reductions in blood glucose level, serum urea, and creatinine as well as significant increases in body weight, insulin activity, and protein levels. In addition, the diabetic rats that did not receive strawberry extract (control) exhibited an increase in plasma glucose, urea, uric acid, creatinine, and a decrease in body weight and insulin levels.

We used liver tissue, serum exosomes and isolated hepatocytes from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and leptin receptor (Lepr) knockout rats to investigate the correlation between hepatic Lepr defective and liver damage caused by metformin. Through immunostaining, RT-PCR and glucose uptake monitoring, we showed that metformin treatment activates adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and its downstream cytochrome C oxidase (CCO). This leads to overactivation of glucose catabolism-related genes, excessive energy repertoire consumption, and subsequent hepatocyte pyroptosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing further confirmed the hyper-activation of glucose catabolism after metformin treatment. Altogether, we showed that functional Lepr is necessary for metformin treatment to be effective, and that long-term metformin treatment might promote NAFLD progression in leptin-insensitive individuals. This provides important insight into the clinical application of metformin.",10.1038/s41419-023-05623-4

"Initial symptoms included leaf tissue Water loss, chloro-sis and elliptical lesions scattered across the leaf margin with further development leading to ellipse-shaped disease spots and leaf wilting (Fig",Water,Fig,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,First report of Botrytis cinerea causing gray mold on Alternanthera philoxeroides in China.,"Alternanthera philoxeroides is a perennial herbaceous plant used as a forage crop (Wang et al. 2005) and is known to have medicinal properties. One of notable active components is flavonoids, which have been found to exhibit anti-Hepatitis B Virus activity (Li et al. 2016). In 2021, a leaf spot on A. philoxeroides was observed in the science and education experimental park of Hebei Agricultural University (38°49'38″ N, 115°26'39″ E). Initial symptoms included leaf tissue water loss, chloro-sis and elliptical lesions scattered across the leaf margin with further development leading to ellipse-shaped disease spots and leaf wilting (Fig. 1A). In the field, 50 plants of A. philoxeroides were randomly selected to investigate and quantify dis-ease. Incidence of leaf disease was approximately 25%, and the infected leaves ex-hibited an average affected area of about 20%. In order to identify the pathogen, three diseased plants were randomly selected from different areas. Stems and leaves of diseased plants were cut into pieces (2 to 3 mm × 5 mm) and disinfested with 1% sodium hypochlorite for 1 minute. After rinsing with sterile water three times, each lesion sample was isolated and purified on PDA at 25°C. Eventually, all samples pro-duced morphologically consistent colonies of pure strains. From the 9 isolates ob-tained, ZLQ-1 was selected as a representative isolate for further study. Colonies were initially white, turning gray from the centre, then gray-brown with cottony aerial hyphae, and finally growing black, stiff, round or irregular sclerotia (0.6 to 4.0 mm × 1.1 to 4.2 mm, n=50) (Fig1. B, C). ZLQ-1 exhibited branched conidia with en-larged apical cells. The conidia of this isolate were unicellular, ovoid or ellipsoid in shape, with dimensions ranging from 5.8 to 16.9 μm × 6.3 to 11.2 μm (n=50) (Fig. 1D). These morphological characteristics were consistent with Botrytis cinerea (Ellis, 1971). The genes of internal transcribed spacer (ITS), heat shock protein (HSP60), DNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunit II (RPB2), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) were amplified with specific primers ITS1/ITS4, HSP60-F/HSP60-R, RPB2-F/RPB2-R and G3PDH-F/G3PDH-R (Aktaruzzaman et al., 2022). Sequences were deposited into GenBank with accession numbers ON479490 for ITS, ON572246 for G3PDH, ON572248 for HSP60, ON572247 for RPB2. BLASTn analysis showed that the ITS sequence shared 99.62% similarity to B. cinerea (CP009808), and the sequences of the other three nuclear protein-encoding genes (G3PDH, HSP60, and RPB2) showed at least 99.9% identity with the genome of B. ci-nerea (B05.10) (Staats et al. 2005). We have inoculated 10 healthy A. philoxeroides leaves with a suspension of 1x105 spores/mL, and used sterile water treatment as control (Aktaruzzaman et al., 2022). Each leaf was inoculated with 10 μL spore sus-pension. After 7 days in a controlled incubation environment (25℃, 40%RH), the plants inoculated with conidial suspensions displayed lesions covered in a gray-white mycelial layer, resembling those observed in the field (Fig. 1E-G).

Bempedoic acid is a novel therapeutic agent that is designed to reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The purpose of this review is to provide the background for development of bempedoic acid, findings from clinical trials and to discuss clinical implications.


RECENT FINDINGS
Bempedoic acid inhibits ATP citrate lyase within the liver and reduces cholesterol synthesis, with the potential to avoid muscle symptoms experienced by patients treated with statins. Early clinical studies demonstrated that administration of bempedoic acid resulted in lowering of LDL-C by 20-30% as monotherapy and by 40-50% when combined with ezetimibe, in addition to lowering of high sensitivity C-reactive protein by 20-30%. The CLEAR Outcomes trial of high cardiovascular risk patients, with elevated LDL-C levels and either unable or unwilling to take statins demonstrated that bempedoic acid reduced the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events. A greater incidence of elevation of hepatic transaminase and creatinine, gout, and cholelithiasis were consistently observed in bempedoic acid-treated patients. Bempedoic acid presents an additional therapeutic option to achieve more effective lowering of LDL-C levels and reduction in cardiovascular risk.",10.1007/s11883-024-01188-5

An 11-month-old infant weighing 9.7 kg was scheduled for an elective laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair surgery. Anesthesia was induced with oxygen, nitrous oxide, and sevoflurane. After loss of consciousness, mask ventilation became impossible, and laryngospasm was suspected. Intravenous access was attempted without success; as there was no immediate access to succinylcholine, rocuronium 10 mg (1.0 mg/kg) was injected intramuscularly into the vastus lateralis muscle. We were able to mask-ventilate the patient within one minute of intramuscular rocuronium, followed by successful endotracheal intubation with a video laryngoscope. The duration of hypoxia (saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2) < 90%) was approximately two minutes, and the patient's lowest oxygen saturation during induction was 76%.

Accurate measurements of the effects it has on neurotransmitters are essential in developing new strategies for smoking cessation. Moreover, measurements of neurotransmitter levels can aid in developing drugs that counteract the effects of smoking. The aim of this study is to develop and validate a fast, simultaneous and sensitive method for measuring the levels of neurotransmitters in rat brain after the exposure of tobacco cigarettes. The selected neurotransmitters include dopamine, GABA, serotonin, glutamine and glutamate. The method is based on high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Chromatographic separation was achieved within 3 min using a Zorbax SB C18 column (3.0 × 100 mm, 1.8 μm particle size).

The molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of addiction/dependence on Morphine may result from the ability of the opioid to diminish the transport of L-Cysteine into neurons via inhibition of excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAA3),Morphine,Cysteine,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,L-cysteine ethyl ester prevents and reverses acquired physical dependence on morphine in male Sprague Dawley rats.,"The molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of addiction/dependence on morphine may result from the ability of the opioid to diminish the transport of L-cysteine into neurons via inhibition of excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAA3). The objective of this study was to determine whether the co-administration of the cell-penetrant L-thiol ester, L-cysteine ethyl ester (L-CYSee), would reduce physical dependence on morphine in male Sprague Dawley rats. Injection of the opioid-receptor antagonist, naloxone HCl (NLX; 1.5 mg/kg, IP), elicited pronounced withdrawal phenomena in rats which received a subcutaneous depot of morphine (150 mg/kg) for 36 h and were receiving a continuous infusion of saline (20 μL/h, IV) via osmotic minipumps for the same 36 h period. The withdrawal phenomena included wet-dog shakes, jumping, rearing, fore-paw licking, 360° circling, writhing, apneas, cardiovascular (pressor and tachycardia) responses, hypothermia, and body weight loss. NLX elicited substantially reduced withdrawal syndrome in rats that received an infusion of L-CYSee (20.8 μmol/kg/h, IV) for 36 h. NLX precipitated a marked withdrawal syndrome in rats that had received subcutaneous depots of morphine (150 mg/kg) for 48 h) and a co-infusion of vehicle. However, the NLX-precipitated withdrawal signs were markedly reduced in morphine (150 mg/kg for 48 h)-treated rats that began receiving an infusion of L-CYSee (20.8 μmol/kg/h, IV) at 36 h. In similar studies to those described previously, neither L-cysteine nor L-serine ethyl ester (both at 20.8 μmol/kg/h, IV) mimicked the effects of L-CYSee. This study demonstrates that 1) L-CYSee attenuates the development of physical dependence on morphine in male rats and 2) prior administration of L-CYSee reverses morphine dependence, most likely by intracellular actions within the brain. The lack of the effect of L-serine ethyl ester (oxygen atom instead of sulfur atom) strongly implicates thiol biochemistry in the efficacy of L-CYSee. Accordingly, L-CYSee and analogs may be a novel class of therapeutics that ameliorate the development of physical dependence on opioids in humans.",10.3389/fphar.2023.1303207

Recent studies have shown an association between trace elements and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but the relationship between trace elements and SLE is still unclear. This study aims to determine the distribution of plasma trace elements in newly diagnosed SLE patients and the association between these essential and toxic element mixtures and SLE.


METHODS
In total, 110 SLE patients and 110 healthy controls were included. Blood samples were collected. 15 plasma trace elements were quantified using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Multivariate logistic regression, restricted cubic spline (RCS), weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression, quantile g-computation (qgcomp), and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) are used to analyze the association between single and mixed exposure of elements and SLE.


RESULTS
The logistic regression model shows that, plasma lithium (Li) [OR (95 % CI): 1.963 (1.49-2.586)], vanadium (V) [OR (95 % CI): 2.617(1.645-4.166)] and lead (Pb) [OR (95 % CI): 1.603(1.197-2.145)] were positively correlated with SLE, while selenium (Se) [OR (95 % CI): 0.055(0.019-0.157)] and barium (Ba) [OR (95 % CI): 0.792(0.656-0.957)] had been identified as protective factors for SLE. RCS results showed a non-linear correlation between the elements Li, V, Ni, copper, Se, rubidium and SLE. In addition, WQS regression, qgcomp, and BKMR models consistently revealed significant positive effects of plasma Li and Pb on SLE, as well as significant negative effects of plasma Se.


CONCLUSIONS
Exposure to heavy metals such as Li and Pb is significantly positively correlated with SLE, but Se may be protective factors for SLE. In addition, there is a nonlinear correlation between the elements Li and Se and SLE, and there are complex interactions between the elements. In the future, larger populations and prospective studies are needed to confirm these associations.",10.1016/j.jtemb.2024.127524

Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is a Trop-2-directed antibody-drug conjugate containing cytotoxic SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. SG received accelerated US Food and Drug Administration approval for locally advanced (LA) or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor, based on cohort 1 of the TROPHY-U-01 study. Mutations in the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) gene are associated with increased adverse events (AEs) with irinotecan-based therapies. Whether UGT1A1 status could impact SG toxicity and efficacy remains unclear.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
TROPHY-U-01 (NCT03547973) is a multicohort, open-label, phase II registrational study. Cohort 1 includes patients with LA or mUC who progressed after platinum- and checkpoint inhibitor-based therapies. SG was administered at 10 mg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per central review; secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Post hoc safety analyses were exploratory with descriptive statistics. Updated analyses include longer follow-up.


RESULTS
Cohort 1 included 113 patients. At a median follow-up of 10.5 months, ORR was 28% (95% CI 20.2% to 37.6%). Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 5.4 months (95% CI 3.5-6.9 months) and 10.9 months (95% CI 8.9-13.8 months), respectively. Occurrence of grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs and treatment-related discontinuation were consistent with prior reports. UGT1A1 status was wildtype (∗1|∗1) in 40%, heterozygous (∗1|∗28) in 42%, homozygous (∗28|∗28) in 12%, and missing in 6% of patients. In patients with ∗1|∗1, ∗1|∗28, and ∗28|∗28 genotypes, any grade treatment-related AEs occurred in 93%, 94%, and 100% of patients, respectively, and were managed similarly regardless of UGT1A1 status.


CONCLUSIONS
With longer follow-up, the ORR remains high in patients with heavily pretreated LA or mUC. Safety data were consistent with the known SG toxicity profile. AE incidence varied across UGT1A1 subgroups; however, discontinuation rates remained relatively low for all groups.",10.1016/j.annonc.2024.01.002

Patients with mUC who received first-line systemic therapy were identified from a Japanese electronic medical records database. A Sankey diagram was used to present the proportion of patients who transitioned to second- and third-line therapies. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate the time to next treatment (TTNT) and overall survival (OS).


RESULTS
A total of 794 patients were included in this study. The median age of the patients was 73.0 years, and 72.9% were male. The most common primary tumor site was the bladder (59.7%). First-line therapy comprised cisplatin-based regimens in 52.0% of the patients (11.8% at standard doses, 32.4% at reduced doses, and 7.8% at unknown doses), carboplatin-based regimens in 32.1%, and other regimens in 15.9%. Among the patients enrolled after 2017, following the approval of pembrolizumab for mUC progressing after chemotherapy in Japan, 58.2% received pembrolizumab as second-line therapy, and 19.1% received EV monotherapy as third-line therapy. The median OS for the total population was 24.1 months, with patients enrolled between 2010 and 2016 having a shorter OS (21.1 months) than those enrolled between 2017 and 2022 (24.9 months). For patients with eGFRs of ≥60 and <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the median OS was 24.1 and 23.8 months, respectively.


CONCLUSION
Platinum-based regimens, including reduced-dose cisplatin and carboplatin, remain the predominant first-line systemic therapies. Since 2017, pembrolizumab and EV have become widespread choices for second-line and subsequent treatments, gradually surpassing the previously prevalent platinum-based regimens. The introduction of these novel therapies might have prolonged the OS of patients with mUC. A plain language summary is available in this article.",10.1016/j.urolonc.2024.09.020

Rogaratinib, an oral pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR1-4) inhibitor, showed promising phase I efficacy and safety in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC) with FGFR1-3 mRNA overexpression. We assessed rogaratinib efficacy and safety versus chemotherapy in patients with FGFR mRNA-positive advanced/metastatic UC previously treated with platinum chemotherapy.


METHODS
FORT-1 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03410693) was a phase II/III, randomized, open-label trial. Patients with FGFR1/3 mRNA-positive locally advanced or metastatic UC with ≥ 1 prior platinum-containing regimen were randomly assigned (1:1) to rogaratinib (800 mg orally twice daily, 3-week cycles; n = 87) or chemotherapy (docetaxel 75 mg/m2, paclitaxel 175 mg/m2, or vinflunine 320 mg/m2 intravenously once every 3 weeks; n = 88). The primary end point was overall survival, with objective response rate (ORR) analysis planned following phase II accrual. Because of comparable efficacy between treatments, enrollment was stopped before progression to phase III; a full interim analysis of phase II was completed.


RESULTS
ORRs were 20.7% (rogaratinib, 18/87; 95% CI, 12.7 to 30.7) and 19.3% (chemotherapy, 17/88; 95% CI, 11.7 to 29.1). Median overall survival was 8.3 months (95% CI, 6.5 to not estimable) and 9.8 months (95% CI, 6.8 to not estimable; hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.72; P = .67). Grade 3/4 events occurred in 37 (43.0%)/4 (4.7%) patients and 32 (39.0%)/15 (18.3%), respectively. No rogaratinib-related deaths occurred. Exploratory analysis of patients with FGFR3 DNA alterations showed ORRs of 52.4% (11/21; 95% CI, 29.8 to 74.3) for rogaratinib and 26.7% (4/15; 95% CI, 7.8 to 55.1) for chemotherapy.


CONCLUSION
To our knowledge, these are the first data to compare FGFR-directed therapy with chemotherapy in patients with FGFR-altered UC, showing comparable efficacy and manageable safety. Exploratory testing suggested FGFR3 DNA alterations in association with FGFR1/3 mRNA overexpression may be better predictors of rogaratinib response.",10.1200/JCO.21.02303

This exploratory analysis evaluated efficacy and safety data for enfortumab vedotin versus chemotherapy over a median follow-up of ∼2 years from EV-301.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients with locally advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma with prior platinum-containing chemotherapy and disease progression during/after programmed cell death protein 1/ligand 1 inhibitor treatment were randomized to enfortumab vedotin or chemotherapy (docetaxel, paclitaxel, vinflunine). Endpoints were overall survival (primary), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response, and safety.


RESULTS
In total, 608 patients were included (enfortumab vedotin, n = 301; chemotherapy, n = 307). With a median follow-up of 23.75 months, 444 deaths had occurred (enfortumab vedotin, n = 207; chemotherapy, n = 237). Risk of death was reduced by 30% with enfortumab vedotin versus chemotherapy [hazard ratio (HR) 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-0.85); one-sided, log-rank P = 0.00015]; PFS improved with enfortumab vedotin [HR 0.63 (95% CI 0.53-0.76); one-sided, log-rank P < 0.00001]. Treatment-related adverse event rates were 93.9% for enfortumab vedotin and 91.8% for chemotherapy; grade ≥ 3 event rates were 52.4% and 50.5%, respectively. Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related decreased neutrophil count (14.1% versus 6.1%), decreased white blood cell count (7.2% versus 1.4%), and anemia (7.9% versus 2.7%) were more common with chemotherapy versus enfortumab vedotin; maculopapular rash (7.4% versus 0%), fatigue (6.8% versus 4.5%), and peripheral sensory neuropathy (5.1% versus 2.1%) were more common with enfortumab vedotin. Of special interest adverse events, treatment-related skin reactions occurred in 47.3% of patients receiving enfortumab vedotin and 15.8% of patients receiving chemotherapy; peripheral neuropathy occurred in 48.0% versus 31.6%, respectively, and hyperglycemia in 6.8% versus 0.3%.


CONCLUSIONS
After a median follow-up of ∼2 years, enfortumab vedotin maintained clinically meaningful overall survival benefit versus chemotherapy, consistent with findings from the EV-301 primary analysis; PFS and overall response benefit remained consistent.

Despite advances in precision medicine, most patients with recurrent or metastatic salivary gland carcinoma still need conventional chemotherapies, such as the combination of taxane and platinum. However, evidence for these standardized regimens is limited.


Methods
We retrospectively reviewed patients with salivary gland carcinoma treated with a taxane and platinum, which contained docetaxel at a dose of 60 mg/m2 plus cisplatin at a dose of 70 mg/m2 on day 1, or paclitaxel at a dose of 100 mg/m2 plus carboplatin at a dose of area under the plasma concentration-time curve = 2.5 on days 1 and 8 (both on 21-day cycles), between January 2000 and September 2021.


Result
Forty patients with ten adenoid cystic carcinomas and thirty other pathologies were identified. Of these, 29 patients were treated with docetaxel plus cisplatin and 11 with paclitaxel plus carboplatin. For the total population, the objective response rate (ORR) and median progression-free survival (mPFS) were 37.5% and 5.4 months (95% confidence interval: 3.6-7.4 months), respectively. On subgroup analysis, docetaxel plus cisplatin provided favorable efficacy compared with paclitaxel plus carboplatin (ORR: 46.5% vs. 20.0%, mPFS: 7.2 vs. 2.8 months), and the findings were well retained in patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma (ORR: 60.0% vs. 0%, mPFS: 17.7 vs. 2.8 months). Grade 3/4 neutropenia was relatively frequent in the docetaxel plus cisplatin (59% vs.27%), although febrile neutropenia was uncommon (3%) in the cohort. No treatment-related death was seen in any case.


Conclusion
The combination of taxane and platinum is generally effective and well-tolerated for recurrent or metastatic salivary gland carcinoma. In contrast, paclitaxel plus carboplatin appears unfavorable in terms of efficacy in certain patients, such as those with adenoid cystic carcinoma.",10.3389/fonc.2023.1185198

The studies were terminated on the tenth day of the experiment. Our data showed that 7-HMIA reduced the disease activity index and spleen/body weight (S/B) ratio, and improved the shortened colon length comparable to the effects of 5-ASA observed in the DSS-exposed mice. 7-HMIA, like 5-ASA, inhibited the histological damage, such as a thickened colonic muscle layer and shortened crypt length in the colon of the mice with DSS-induced colitis. 7-HMIA restored the tight junction-related proteins (occludin, claudin-1, and claudin-2) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition-mediated proteins (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin) in the colon tissue of mice with DSS-induced colitis. Additionally, 7-HMIA (20 mg/kg/day) showed the inhibitory effects similar to that of 5-ASA on the myeloperoxidase activity, interleukin (IL)-6 production, and expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and even showed greater inhibition of IL-1β production in the DSS-induced mice. Furthermore, the DSS-induced activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were effectively suppressed by 7-HMIA treatment like the effects of 5-ASA. Overall, our findings revealed that 7-HMIA decreased the severity of colitis by protecting the inflamed mucosal barrier by interfering with NF-κB and STAT3 activation.",10.1016/j.cbi.2022.110316

The results showed that low-dose SePPs (15 μg Se per kg per d bw) could effectively alleviate DSS-induced inflammatory bowel disease through the improvement of the antioxidant levels, reduction of inflammatory factor levels, and increase of tight junction protein expression of ZO-1 and occludin in the colon, thus improving the structure of the colon and strengthening the barrier function of the small intestine. Additionally, SePPs were found to significantly improve the production of short chain fatty acids (P < 0.05).

Sodium picosulfate (SP)/magnesium citrate (MC) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) plus ascorbic acid are recommended by Western guidelines as laxative solutions for bowel preparation. Clinically, SP/MC has a slower post-dose defaecation response than PEG and is perceived as less cleansing; therefore, it is not currently used for major bowel cancer screening preparation. The standard formulation for bowel preparation is PEG; however, a large dose is required, and it has a distinctive flavour that is considered unpleasant. SP/MC requires a small dose and ensures fluid intake because it is administered in another beverage. Therefore, clinical trials have shown that SP/MC is superior to PEG in terms of acceptability. We aim to compare the novel bowel cleansing method (test group) comprising SP/MC with elobixibat hydrate and the standard bowel cleansing method comprising PEG plus ascorbic acid (standard group) for patients preparing for outpatient colonoscopy.


METHODS
This phase III, multicentre, single-blind, noninferiority, randomised, controlled, trial has not yet been completed. Patients aged 40-69 years will be included as participants. Patients with a history of abdominal or pelvic surgery, constipation, inflammatory bowel disease, or severe organ dysfunction will be excluded. The target number of research participants is 540 (standard group, 270 cases; test group, 270 cases). The primary endpoint is the degree of bowel cleansing (Boston Bowel Preparation Scale [BBPS] score ≥ 6). The secondary endpoints are patient acceptability, adverse events, polyp/adenoma detection rate, number of polyps/adenomas detected, degree of bowel cleansing according to the BBPS (BBPS score ≥ 8), degree of bowel cleansing according to the Aronchik scale, and bowel cleansing time.


DISCUSSION
This trial aims to develop a ""patient-first"" colon cleansing regimen without the risk of inadequate bowel preparation by using both elobixibat hydrate and SP/MC.

"These effects may be associated with the high levels of Ginsenoside Rg1, Re and Rb1 and rich variety of compounds in S-Nb including 6 Ginsenosides, glycyrrhizin, L-tryptophan, and so on",Ginsenoside Rg1,Ginsenoside,Component-Whole,component-whole,Transcriptome profiling Revealed the potential mechanisms of Shen Lin Bai Zhu San n-butanol extract on DSS induced Colitis in Mice and LC-MS analysis.,"BACKGROUND
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and recurrent inflammatory disorder in gastrointestinal tract. Shen Ling Bai Zhu San (SLBZS), which has a long history of use in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), has been widely used to treat gastrointestinal diseases. The isolated fractions of TCM have also been proved to possess an important potential for treating diseases, which are due to their effective components.


PURPOSE
In this study, we examined the possibility that SLBZS and its isolated active fractions may prevent DSS-induced colitis, and investigated the potential mechanisms by regulating genetic profile of colon.


METHODS
Colitis mice were induced by 2.5% DSS for 7 days, and then SLBZS and different SLBZS extracts were administrated to protect the mice for 7 days. Body weight, diarrhea, bleeding in stool, colon length, spleen weight, cytokines of serum and colon and pathology of colon were assessed. The level of Ginsenoside Rg1, Re and Rb1 in different SLBZS extracts and qualitative analysis of n-butanol extract of SLBZS (S-Nb) was performed by HPLC and LC-MS, respectively. And the effects of S-Nb on the transcriptome in colitis were investigated.


RESULTS
Our results showed that SLBZS and S-Nb significantly regained body weight, reduced DAI, splenomegaly and the length of colon and attenuated histological damage of the colon. Meanwhile, SLBZS and S-Nb markedly reduced the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 and increased the level of IL-10 in serum and colon. These effects may be associated with the high levels of Ginsenoside Rg1, Re and Rb1 and rich variety of compounds in S-Nb including 6 ginsenosides, glycyrrhizin, L-tryptophan, and so on. Transcriptome analysis revealed that S-Nb selectively regulated 103 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 36 of which were changed in DSS-induced mice. And the genes of Per2, Per3, Npy and Serpina3m were closely related to colitis and also restored by S-Nb with different extent. Remarkably, these DEGs modulated the biological functions of colitis mice, including extracellular region, response to external stimulus, MAPK signaling pathway and arginine and proline metabolism.


CONCLUSIONS
These data indicated that SLBZS and S-Nb blunted DSS-induced colitis by modulating differentially expression gene profile and biological functions based on their ginsenosides and rich compounds.",10.1016/j.phymed.2023.154645

We examined the preventative effects of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) on epithelial barrier integrity and intestinal inflammation in an interleukin (IL)-6-induced cell model and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced acute mouse colitis model. HMOs including 2'-fucosyllactose (FL) and 3-FL and positive controls including fructooligosaccharide (FOS) and 5-acetylsalicylic acid (5-ASA) were orally administrated once per day to C57BL/6J mice with colitis induced by 5% DSS in the administered drinking water. 2'-FL and 3-FL did not affect the cell viability in Caco-2 cells. Meanwhile, these agents reversed IL-6-reduced intestinal barrier function in Caco-2 cells. Furthermore, 2'-FL and 3-FL reversed the body weight loss and the remarkably short colon lengths in DSS-induced acute colitis mice. Moreover, 2'-FL and 3-FL obviously protected the decreasing expression of zonula occluden-1 and occludin in colon tissue relative to the findings in the DSS-treated control group. 2'-FL and 3-FL significantly reduced IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α levels in serum relative to the control findings. The summary of these results shows that HMOs prevent colitis mainly by enhancing intestinal barrier function and advancing anti-inflammatory responses.

In such oil-water emulsions, the resin molecules are bound by π-π stacking and bind to interfacial water molecules via hydrogen bonds, which impede the aggregation between water droplets and thereby the separation of the emulsion. In this study, strongly electronegative oxygen atoms (in ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, esters, and hydroxyl groups) were introduced through poly(propylene glycol)-block-polyether and esterification with acrylic acid to attract negative charges in order to form electron-rich regions and enhance interfacial hydrogen bond recombination. The potential distribution in the demulsifier molecules and their space occupancy were regulated by the polymerization reaction to destroy the π-π stacking interaction between resin molecules. The results show that the binding energies (binding free energy and hydrogen bonding energy) of oxygen-containing demulsifier molecules with water molecules were higher than those of resin molecules with water molecules, resulting in the fission of the hydrogen bonds between resin and water molecules. The introduction of demulsifier molecules that occupied large interfacial space reduced the binding energy between resin molecules from -2176.06 to -110.00 kJ·mol-1. Noteworthy, the binding energy between demulsifier molecules and resin molecules was -1076.36 kJ·mol-1 lower than that between resin molecules (-110.00 kJ·mol-1), indicating the adsorption of the surrounding interfacial resin molecules by the demulsifier molecules and destruction of the π-π stacking between them, thus favoring the collapse of the interfacial structure of the oil-water emulsion and achieving its separation. This study provides important theoretical support for the treatment of oil-contaminated soil and offshore oil spill pollution.",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132525

The pore structure, surface oxygen-containing functional groups, and their influence on methane adsorption by CAC as the simplified coal model were investigated by using low-temperature nitrogen adsorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Boehm titration, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results showed that tectonic deformation fostered smaller pores, particularly ultramicropores in TDC, dominating methane adsorption. Acid-modified TDC-based activated carbons (ACs) showed higher pore parameters and oxygen-containing functional groups than those of PSC-based ACs. Nitric acid introduced abundant carboxyl groups concurrently increasing the pore volume and specific surface area (SSA), while sulfuric acid-ammonium persulfate treatment resulted in increased lactone groups and a partial collapse/blockage of nanopores. Methane adsorption experiments confirmed the importance of micropores and revealed a significant decrease in capacity owing to increased oxygen-containing functional groups as the primary role, with pore wall corrosion playing a secondary role. Thus, the study highlights the surface effects of TDC on methane adsorption and the potential for producing high-performance methane storage materials from China's tectonic coal resources.",10.1021/acsomega.4c00978

However, metabolic changes in paclitaxel resistance remain unclear. Herein, we present the metabolic alternations of paclitaxel resistance in bioenergetic profiling in OCCC. Paclitaxel-resistant OCCC cells were developed and metabolically active with oxygen consumption rates (OCR) compared to parental cells. Metabolite profiling analysis revealed that paclitaxel-resistant OCCC cells reduced intracellular ATP and GTP influx rates, increasing the NADH/NAD+ ratio. We further demonstrated that paclitaxel-resistant OCCC cells led to characteristic alternations of metabolite levels in energy-requiring and energy-releasing steps of glycolysis and their corresponding glycolytic enzymes. Copy number alterations and RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and solute carrier (SLC) transporter genes involved in glycolysis metabolism and molecular transport were enriched in paclitaxel-resistant OCCC cells. We first identified that Hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression is upregulated in paclitaxel-resistant OCCC cells to determine the quantity of glucose entering glycolysis. Utilizing proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) HK2 degraders, we also found that paclitaxel sensitivity, viability, and oxygen consumption rates under paclitaxel treatment were restored by HK2 degraders treatment, and decreased downstream expression of the ABC and SLC transporters was shown in OCCC cells.

Phase separation is powered by multivalent macromolecular interactions. Importantly, the release of water molecules from protein hydration shells into bulk creates entropic gains that promote phase separation and the subsequent generation of insoluble cytotoxic aggregates that drive healthy brain cells into diseased states. Higher viscosity in interfacial waters and limited hydration in interiors of biomolecular condensates facilitate phase separation. Light, water, and melatonin constitute an ancient synergy that ensures adequate protein hydration to prevent aberrant phase separation. The 670 nm visible red wavelength found in sunlight and employed in photobiomodulation reduces interfacial and mitochondrial matrix viscosity to enhance ATP production via increasing ATP synthase motor efficiency. Melatonin is a potent antioxidant that lowers viscosity to increase ATP by scavenging excess reactive oxygen species and free radicals. Reduced viscosity by light and melatonin elevates the availability of free water molecules that allow melatonin to adopt favorable conformations that enhance intrinsic features, including binding interactions with adenosine that reinforces the adenosine moiety effect of ATP responsible for preventing water removal that causes hydrophobic collapse and aggregation in phase separation.

Nur77 belongs to the member of orphan nuclear receptor 4A family that plays critical roles in maintaining vascular homeostasis. This study aims to determine whether Nur77 plays a role in attenuating vascular dysfunction, and if so, to determine the molecular mechanisms involved.


METHODS
Both Nur77 knockout (Nur77 KO) and Nur77 endothelial specific transgenic mice (Nur77-Tg) were employed to examine the functional significance of Nur77 in vascular endothelium in vivo. Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation to acetylcholine (Ach) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was determined under inflammatory and high glucose conditions. Expression of genes was determined by real-time PCR and western blot analysis.


RESULTS
In response to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) treatment and diabetes, the endothelium-dependent vasodilatation to Ach was significantly impaired in aorta from Nur77 KO as compared with those from the wild-type (WT) mice. Endothelial specific overexpression of Nur77 markedly prevented both TNF-α- and high glucose-induced endothelial dysfunction. Compared with WT mice, after TNF-α and high glucose treatment, ROS production in aorta was significantly increased in Nur77 KO mice, but it was inhibited in Nur77-Tg mice, as determined by dihydroethidium (DHE) staining. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Nur77 overexpression substantially increased the expression of several key enzymes involved in nitric oxide (NO) production and ROS scavenging, including endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH-1), glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1), and superoxide dismutases (SODs). Mechanistically, we found that Nur77 increased GCH1 mRNA stability by inhibiting the expression of microRNA-133a, while Nur77 upregulated SOD1 expression through directly binding to the human SOD1 promoter in vascular endothelial cells.


CONCLUSION
Our results suggest that Nur77 plays an essential role in attenuating endothelial dysfunction through activating NO production and anti-oxidant pathways in vascular endothelium. Targeted activation of Nur77 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases associated with endothelial dysfunction.",10.1016/j.redox.2024.103056

The unprecedented disruption of social life and public health caused by COVID-19 calls for fast-track development of diagnostic kits, vaccines, and antiviral drugs. Small molecule antivirals are essential complements of vaccines and can be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Currently, there are three FDA-approved antiviral drugs, remdesivir, molnupiravir, and paxlovid. Given the moderate clinical efficacy of remdesivir and molnupiravir, the drug-drug interaction of paxlovid, and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with potential drug-resistant mutations, there is a pressing need for additional antivirals to combat current and future coronavirus outbreaks.In this Account, we describe our efforts in developing covalent and noncovalent main protease (Mpro) inhibitors and the identification of nirmatrelvir-resistant mutants. We initially discovered GC376, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and boceprevir as dual inhibitors of Mpro and host cathepsin L from a screening of a protease inhibitor library. Given the controversy of targeting cathepsin L, we subsequently shifted the focus to designing Mpro-specific inhibitors. Specifically, guided by the X-ray crystal structures of these initial hits, we designed noncovalent Mpro inhibitors such as Jun8-76-3R that are highly selective toward Mpro over host cathepsin L. Using the same scaffold, we also designed covalent Mpro inhibitors with novel cysteine reactive warheads containing di- and trihaloacetamides, which similarly had high target specificity. In parallel to our drug discovery efforts, we developed the cell-based FlipGFP Mpro assay to characterize the cellular target engagement of our rationally designed Mpro inhibitors. The FlipGFP assay was also applied to validate the structurally disparate Mpro inhibitors reported in the literature. Lastly, we introduce recent progress in identifying naturally occurring Mpro mutants that are resistant to nirmatrelvir from genome mining of the nsp5 sequences deposited in the GISAID database.

Since COVID-19 patients are often polytreated, monitoring drug-drug interaction (DDIs) is necessary. We evaluated whether drugs used after the second COVID-19 pandemic wave were associated with DDI-related adverse events and the role of drug interaction checkers in identifying them.


METHODS
The study (PROSPERO-ID: CRD42024507634) included: 1) consulting the drug interaction checkers Drugs.com, Liverpool COVID-19 Interactions, LexiComp, Medscape, and Micromedex; 2) systematic review; 3) reviewed studies analysis; 4) evaluating drug interaction checkers potential to anticipate DDI-related adverse events.The systematic review was performed searching PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane databases from 1 March 2022 to 11 November 2023. Observational studies, and clinical trials were included. Article without reporting direct association between DDIs and adverse events were excluded. The risk of bias was assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa scale.


RESULTS
The most frequent DDIs involved nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (N/R) and fluvoxamine. Fifteen studies, including 150 patients and 35 DDI-related outcomes, were analyzed. The most frequent DDIs involved tacrolimus with N/R, resulting in creatinine increase.Eighty percent of reported DDI-related adverse events would have been identified by all drug-interaction checkers, while the remaining 20% by at least 2 of them.

The PBPK model was also applied to support evaluation of DDI risk as a victim resulting from co-administration with CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 inhibitors, or a CYP3A4 inducer. After refinement with clinical DDI data, the final PBPK model was able to recover the clinically observed single and multiple-dose plasma concentrations for tucatinib when tucatinib was administered as a single agent in healthy subjects.

"CONCLUSIONS
Dicloxacillin increases expression of intestinal P-gp, leading to reduced oral absorption of Dabigatran",Dicloxacillin,Dabigatran,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Dicloxacillin is an inducer of intestinal P-glycoprotein but neither dicloxacillin nor flucloxacillin increases the risk of stroke/systemic embolism in direct oral anticoagulant users.,"AIM
We aimed to assess if dicloxacillin/flucloxacillin reduces the therapeutic efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and the underlying molecular mechanism.


METHODS
In a randomized, crossover study, we assessed whether dicloxacillin reduces oral absorption of drugs through P-glycoprotein (P-gp) during 10 and 28 days of treatment. To study the impact of dicloxacillin/flucloxacillin on intestinal and hepatic expression of P-gp in vitro, we usd LS174T cells and 3D spheroids of primary human hepatocytes. Finally, we used nationwide Danish health registries and the UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of stroke and systemic embolism following dicloxacillin/flucloxacillin exposure among DOAC users, using phenoxymethylpenicillin and amoxicillin as active comparators.


RESULTS
Dicloxacillin reduced the area under the curve of dabigatran to a geometric mean ratio 10 days of 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42-1.1) and geometric mean ratio 28 days of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.39-1.4), suggesting reduced oral absorption via increased P-gp expression. In vitro, dicloxacillin raised P-gp expression in both intestinal and liver cells, while flucloxacillin only affected liver cells. In the pharmacoepidemiologic study, dicloxacillin and flucloxacillin were not associated with increased risk of stroke/systemic embolism (dicloxacillin vs. phenoxymethylpenicillin HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.72-1.2; flucloxacillin vs. amoxicillin HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.51-1.5).


CONCLUSIONS
Dicloxacillin increases expression of intestinal P-gp, leading to reduced oral absorption of dabigatran. However, concomitant use of dicloxacillin/flucloxacillin was not associated with stroke and systemic embolism among DOAC users, suggesting no clinical impact from the drug-drug interaction between dicloxacillin/flucloxacillin and DOACs.",10.1111/bcp.16190
"Itraconazole inhibition led to an 81%-85% decrease of total 1β-OH DCA plasma exposures, whereas Rifampin induction led to a 6.8- to 10.3-fold increase of total 1β-OH DCA plasma exposures",Itraconazole,Rifampin,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,1β-Hydroxydeoxycholic Acid as an Endogenous Biomarker in Human Plasma for Assessment of CYP3A Clinical Drug-Drug Interaction Potential.,"4β-Hydroxycholesterol (4β-HC) in plasma has been used as a biomarker to assess CYP3A drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential during drug development. However, due to the long half-life and narrow dynamic range of 4β-HC, its use has been limited to the identification of CYP3A inducers, but not CYP3A inhibitors. The formation of 1β-hydroxydeoxycholic acid (1β-OH DCA) from deoxycholic acid (DCA) is mediated by CYP3A, thus 1β-OH DCA can potentially serve as an alternative to 4β-HC for assessment of CYP3A DDI potential. To study this feasibility, we developed a sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous quantitation of 1β-OH DCA and its glycine and taurine conjugates in human plasma with the lower limit of quantitation of 50 pg/ml, which enabled the quantitation of basal levels and further reduction. The method was applied to a DDI study to assess how 1β-OH DCA and its glycine and taurine conjugates would respond to CYP3A induction or inhibition. Rifampin induction resulted in an increase of 1β-OH DCA and its conjugates in plasma, with 6.8-, 7.8-, 8.3-, and 10.3-fold increases of area under the curve from the time of dosing to the last measurable concentration (AUCLST), area under the curve from the time of dosing to 24 hours (AUC24h), C max, and mean concentrations for total 1β-OH DCA (total of all three forms), respectively. Importantly, inhibition with itraconazole resulted in notable reduction of these biomarkers, with 84%, 85%, 82%, and 81% reductions of AUCLST, AUC24h, C max, and mean concentrations for total 1β-OH DCA, respectively. These preliminary data demonstrate for the first time that total 1β-OH DCA in plasma has the potential to serve as a biomarker for CYP3A DDI assessment in early clinical development and may provide key advantages over 4β-HC. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The authors have reported the use of total 1β-hydroxydeoxycholic acid (1β-OH DCA) (sum of 1β-OH DCA and its glycine and taurine conjugates) plasma exposure as a biomarker for CYP3A activity.

Here the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of pomotrelvir was evaluated for major CYP isoforms, starting with in vitro assays followed by the basic static model assessment. The identified CYP3A4-mediated potential DDIs were evaluated clinically at a supratherapeutic dose of 1050 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) of pomotrelvir, including pomotrelvir coadministration with ritonavir (strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) or midazolam (sensitive substrate of CYP3A4). Furthermore, a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed within the Simcyp Population-based Simulator using in vitro and in vivo information and validated with available human pharmacokinetic (PK) data. The PBPK model was simulated to assess the DDI potential for CYP isoforms that pomotrelvir has shown a weak to moderate DDI in vitro and for CYP3A4 at the therapeutic dose of 700 mg b.i.d. To support the use of pomotrelvir in women of childbearing potential, the impact of pomotrelvir on the exposure of the representative oral hormonal contraceptive drugs ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel was assessed using the PBPK model. The overall assessment suggested weak inhibition of pomotrelvir on CYP3A4 and minimal impact of a strong CYP3A4 inducer or inhibitor on pomotrelvir PK. Therefore, pomotrelvir is not anticipated to have clinically meaningful DDIs at the clinical dose. These comprehensive in vitro, in clinic, and in silico efforts indicate that the DDI potential of pomotrelvir is minimal, so excluding patients on concomitant medicines in clinical studies would not be required.",10.1002/psp4.13034

Placental function is essential for fetal development, but it may be susceptible to malnutrition and environmental stressors.


OBJECTIVE
To assess the impact of toxic and essential trace elements in placenta on placental function.


METHODS
Toxic metals (cadmium, lead, mercury, cobalt) and essential elements (copper, manganese, zinc, selenium) were measured in placenta of 406 pregnant women in northern Sweden using ICP-MS. Placental weight and birth weight were obtained from hospital records and fetoplacental weight ratio was used to estimate placental efficiency. Placental relative telomere length (TL) and mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) were determined by quantitative PCR (n = 285). Single exposure-outcome associations were evaluated using linear or spline regression, and joint associations and interactions with Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), all adjusted for sex, maternal smoking, and age or BMI.


RESULTS
Median cadmium, mercury, lead, cobalt, copper, manganese, zinc, and selenium concentrations in placenta were 3.2, 1.8, 4.3, 2.3, 1058, 66, 10626, and 166 μg/kg, respectively. In the adjusted regression, selenium (>147 μg/kg) was inversely associated with placental weight (B: -158; 95 % CI: -246, -71, per doubling), as was lead at low selenium (B: -23.6; 95 % CI: -43.2, -4.0, per doubling). Manganese was positively associated with placental weight (B: 41; 95 % CI: 5.9, 77, per doubling) and inversely associated with placental efficiency (B: -0.01; 95 % CI: -0.019, -0.004, per doubling). Cobalt was inversely associated with mtDNAcn (B: -11; 95 % CI: -20, -0.018, per doubling), whereas all essential elements were positively associated with mtDNAcn, individually and joint.


CONCLUSION
Among the toxic metals, lead appeared to negatively impact placental weight and cobalt decreased placental mtDNAcn. Joint essential element concentrations increased placental mtDNAcn. Manganese also appeared to increase placental weight, but not birth weight.

The effect of maternal iodine on milk protein secretion remains unknown. We aimed to explore the effect of long-term maternal iodine deficiency and excess on milk protein secretion in lactating rats and its mechanisms preliminarily. Animal models of iodine deficiency and excess were generated by treating Wistar rats a low-iodine diet and deionized water with different potassium iodide concentrations from reproductive age to lactation. Under iodine deficiency, CSN2 and α-LA secretion of milk was inhibited in early and mid-lactation, respectively, and the inhibition of milk CSN2 and α-LA secretion weakened in late lactation. Under iodine excess, milk CSN2 secretion was inhibited in early lactation, and the inhibition of milk CSN2 and α-LA secretion was more pronounced in late lactation. Under iodine deficiency and excess, the concentrations of CSN2 and α-LA and protein expression levels of THRα1, THRβ1, and PRLR in the mammary gland decreased. These results demonstrate the negative impact of long-term maternal iodine malnutrition on milk protein secretion.",10.1016/j.jnutbio.2024.109812
"METHODS
In a crossover-designed study, four different RUTFs were tested for short-term acceptability and organoleptic qualities (two globally available: peanut-based, which is the current standard, and Wheat-milk-based RUTFs; two regionally produced: a mung-Bean-based and a fish-rice-based RUTF)",Wheat,Bean,Component-Whole,component-whole,Short-Term Acceptability of Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Foods in Two Provinces of Lao People's Democratic Republic.,"BACKGROUND
In Lao PDR, acute malnutrition remains a public health problem, with around 9% of children under 5 being affected. Outpatient treatment of severe acute malnutrition requires ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs), but concerns have been raised about the acceptability of globally available products. Culturally acceptable RUTFs could be locally developed, but data are lacking on RUTF preferences in Lao PDR.


METHODS
In a crossover-designed study, four different RUTFs were tested for short-term acceptability and organoleptic qualities (two globally available: peanut-based, which is the current standard, and wheat-milk-based RUTFs; two regionally produced: a mung-bean-based and a fish-rice-based RUTF). Organoleptic properties were evaluated by 83 caretaker-child pair participants through a taste test and a 30 min consumption test. Short-term acceptability was assessed through a 3-day intake test. The study sites were in Phongsaly (North Laos) and Attapeu (South Laos). Focus group discussions were conducted at the beginning and the end of the study.


RESULTS
The mung bean RUTF was the favorite among caretakers, with an acceptability percentage of 96.2%, and scored better (p-value < 0.05) for all organoleptic variables than the other three RUTFs. Overall, 3 days after receiving take-home rations, the mean percentage of consumption was above 80% for all the RUTFs, with the mung bean product being the most consumed.


CONCLUSIONS
The regionally produced mung bean RUTF was the most accepted, whereas the other regionally produced fish-based RUTF was the least accepted, showing the complexity of finding culturally acceptable solutions to fight malnutrition. For Lao PDR, a mung-bean-based RUTF seems the way forward, even if the current standard peanut-based RUTF appeared to be acceptable, albeit not the most preferred.",10.3390/nu15173847

A total of 252 broiler chickens at 28 d old were randomly allocated into 7 treatment groups for a 3-d trial. The dietary treatments included a basal diet (control), a NFD containing corn starch (CS), and 5 NFD with AM/AP ratios of 0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, and 1.00, respectively. As the AM/AP ratio increased, the IEAA losses of all AAs, starch digestibility and maltase activity linearly decreased (P < 0.05), but the DM digestibility linearly and quadratically decreased (P < 0.05). Compared with the control, the NFD increased the number of goblet cells and its regulatory genes mucin-2 and krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF-4) while decreasing serum glucagon and thyroxine concentrations, ileal villus height, and crypt depth (P < 0.05). Additionally, NFD with lower AM/AP ratios (0.20 and 0.40) decreased the ileal microbiota species richness (P < 0.05). In all NFD groups, the number of Proteobacteria increased whereas the abundance of Firmicutes dropped (P < 0.05). However, the broilers in the AM/AP 0.60 group were closer to the digestive physiological state of chickens fed the control diet, with no significant change in maltase activity and mucin-2 expression (P < 0.05). In conclusion, increasing AM/AP ratio in a NFD decreased the IEAA losses and the apparent ileal digestibility of starch but inevitably resulted in malnutrition and disruption of gut microbiota homeostasis. This study recommends AM/AP in NFD at 0.60 to measure IEAA of broiler chickens.",10.1016/j.aninu.2023.03.011

This may affect the efficacy of antibiotics or lead to toxicity, posing a potential risk to the environment and food safety. This study aimed to investigate the DDI of ENR and salinomycin (SAL) in broilers and the mechanism of their DDI. We found that SAL increased the area under the curve and elimination half-life of ENR and ciprofloxacin (CIP) by 1.3 and 2.4 times, 1.2 and 2.5 times, respectively. Cytochrome 3A4 (CYP3A4), p-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) were important factors for the DDI between ENR and SAL in broilers. ENR and SAL are substrates of CYP3A4, P-gp and BCRP in broilers; ENR and SAL inhibited the expression of CYP3A4 activity in a time- and concentration-dependent. Meanwhile, ENR downregulated the expression of P-gp and BCRP in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. A single oral administration of SAL inhibited CYP3A4, P-gp, and BCRP, but long-term mixed feeding upregulated the expression of CYP3A4, P-gp, and BCRP. Molecular docking revealed that ENR and SAL compete with each other for CYP3A4 to affect hepatic metabolism, and compete with ATP for P-gp and BCRP binding sites to inhibit efflux. ENR and SAL in broilers can lead to severe DDI. Drug residues and resistance following co-administration of ENR and SAL and other SAL-based drug-feed interactions warrant further study.",10.3390/antibiotics12020403

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved capivasertib in combination with fulvestrant for adult patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, locally advanced, or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have received at least one previous endocrine therapy and whose tumors harbor one or more phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3CA)/AKT Serine/Threonine Kinase 1 (AKT1)/phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) alterations, as detected by an FDA-approved test.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Approval was based on CAPItello-291, a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial of 708 patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced or MBC, including 289 patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN tumor alterations. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive capivasertib 400 mg twice daily for 4 days per week with fulvestrant versus placebo with fulvestrant. Random assignment was stratified by presence of liver metastases, previous treatment with CDK4/6i, cyclin-dependent kinase four and six (CDK4/6) inhibitors, and geographical region.


RESULTS
A statistically significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit was demonstrated in the overall population (hazard ratio [HR], 0.6 [95% CI, 0.51 to 0.71]); this result was driven by 289 patients in the biomarker-positive population (HR, 0.5 [95% CI, 0.37 to 0.68]). An exploratory analysis of investigator-assessed PFS in the 313 (44%) patients in the biomarker-negative population showed uncertain benefit (HR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.60 to 1.01]). With capivasertib, more patients had Grade ≥3 toxicities. Key concerns included hyperglycemia (18% all-grade, 2.8% Grade ≥3), cutaneous toxicity (58% all-grade, 17% Grade ≥3), and diarrhea (72% all-grade, 9% Grade ≥3).


CONCLUSION
Capivasertib with fulvestrant was approved for patients whose tumors harbored PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN alterations. Benefit-risk assessment in this subgroup was favorable based on a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS in the context of an acceptable safety profile including no evidence of a potential detriment in overall survival. By contrast, the benefit-risk was unfavorable in the biomarker-negative population.",10.1200/JCO.24.00427

Interestingly, through in silico and in vitro analysis, we discovered that GDC-0152 directly modulates the ABCB1-ATPase activity and inhibits ABCB1 multidrug efflux activity at sub-cytotoxic concentrations (i.e., 0.25×IC50 or less). Further investigation revealed that GDC-0152 also decreases BIRC5 expression, induces mitophagy, and lowers intracellular ATP levels in cancer cells at low cytotoxic concentrations (i.e., 0.5×IC50). Co-treatment with GDC-0152 restored the sensitivity to the known ABCB1 substrates, including paclitaxel, vincristine, and YM155 in ABCB1-expressing multidrug-resistant cancer cells, and it also restored the sensitivity to tamoxifen in BIRC5-overexpressing tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, co-treatment with GDC-0152 restored and potentiated the anticancer effects of paclitaxel in ABCB1 and BIRC5 co-expressing xenograft tumors in vivo. In conclusion, GDC-0152 has the potential for use in the management of cancer patients with ABCB1 and BIRC5-related drug resistance. The findings of our study provide essential information to physicians for designing a more patient-specific GDC-0152 clinical trial program in the future.",10.1016/j.taap.2024.116888
"Piperine and Dipyridamole were tested as enhancers alone or encapsulated in bilosomes comprising Span60, Cholesterol and bile salts",Dipyridamole,Cholesterol,Component-Whole,component-whole,Permeation enhancers loaded bilosomes for improved intestinal absorption and cytotoxic activity of doxorubicin.,"The clinical utility of doxorubicin is compromised due to dose related toxic side effects and limited oral bioavailability with no oral formulation being marketed. Enhancement of intestinal absorption and magnification of cytotoxicity can overcome these limitations. Accordingly, the objective was to probe penetration enhancers, bilosomes and their combinations for enhanced intestinal absorption and improved cytotoxicity of doxorubicin. Piperine and dipyridamole were tested as enhancers alone or encapsulated in bilosomes comprising Span60, cholesterol and bile salts. Bilosomes were nanosized spherical vesicles with negative zeta potential and were able to entrap doxorubicin with efficiency ranging from 45.3 % to 53 %. Intestinal absorption studies utilized in-situ rabbit intestinal perfusion which revealed site dependent doxorubicin absorption correlating with regional distribution of efflux transporters. Co-perfusion with the enhancer increased intestinal absorption with further augmentation after bilosomal encapsulation. The latter increased the % fraction absorbed by 4.5-6 and 1.8-2.5-fold from jejuno-ileum and colon, respectively, depending on bilosomes composition. Additionally, doxorubicin cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells (MCF-7) was significantly improved after bilosomal encapsulation and the recorded doxorubicin IC50 value was reduced from 13.3 μM to 0.1 μM for the best formulation. The study introduced bilosomes encapsulating absorption enhancers as promising carriers for enhanced cytotoxicity and oral absorption of doxorubicin.",10.1016/j.ijpharm.2022.122427
"Application of quinone drugs, particularly β-Lapachone (β-lap), under normoxic and hypoxic conditions enabled us to produce ROS in cellulo and to show that β-lap treatment caused PP-InsP changes that are Oxygen-dependent",Lapachone,Oxygen,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,β-lapachone regulates mammalian inositol pyrophosphate levels in an NQO1- and oxygen-dependent manner.,"Inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are energetic signaling molecules with important functions in mammals. As their biosynthesis depends on ATP concentration, PP-InsPs are tightly connected to cellular energy homeostasis. Consequently, an increasing number of studies involve PP-InsPs in metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, aspects of tumorigenesis, and hyperphosphatemia. Research conducted in yeast suggests that the PP-InsP pathway is activated in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the precise modulation of PP-InsPs during cellular ROS signaling is unknown. Here, we report how mammalian PP-InsP levels are changing during exposure to exogenous (H2O2) and endogenous ROS. Using capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS), we found that PP-InsP levels decrease upon exposure to oxidative stressors in HCT116 cells. Application of quinone drugs, particularly β-lapachone (β-lap), under normoxic and hypoxic conditions enabled us to produce ROS in cellulo and to show that β-lap treatment caused PP-InsP changes that are oxygen-dependent. Experiments in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells deficient of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) demonstrated that β-lap requires NQO1 bioactivation to regulate the cellular metabolism of PP-InsPs. Critically, significant reductions in cellular ATP concentrations were not directly mirrored in reduced PP-InsP levels as shown in NQO1-deficient MDA-MB-231 cells treated with β-lap. The data presented here unveil unique aspects of β-lap pharmacology and its impact on PP-InsP levels. The identification of different quinone drugs as modulators of PP-InsP synthesis will allow the overall impact on cellular function of such drugs to be better appreciated.",10.1073/pnas.2306868120

Selye and Szabo describe the cysteamine-induced duodenal ulcer in rats as a duodenal stress ulcer in patients. Szabo's cysteamine duodenal ulcer as the dopamine duodenal healing and cysteamine as a dopamine antagonist signifies the dopamine agonists anti-ulcer effect and dopamine antagonists ulcerogenic effect. From these viewpoints, we focused on dopamine and gastric ulcer healing. We mentioned antecedent studies on the dopamine presence in the stomach and gastric juice. Then we reviewed, in the timeline, therapy significance arising from the anti-ulcer potency of the various dopamine agonists, which is highly prevailing over the quite persistent beneficial evidence arising from the various dopamine antagonists. Meanwhile, the beneficial effects of several peptides (i.e., amylin, cholecystokinin, leptin, and stable gastric pentadecapeptide BPC 157, suggested as an acting mediator of the dopamine brain-gut axis) were included in the dopamine gastric ulcer story. We attempt to resolve dopamine agonists/antagonists issue with the dopamine significance in the stress (cysteamine as a prototype of the duodenal stress ulcer), and cytoprotection (cysteamine in small dose as a prototype of the cytoprotective agents; cysteamine duodenal ulcer in gastrectomized rats). Thereby, along with dopamine agonists' beneficial effects, in special circumstances, dopamine antagonists having their own ulcerogenic effect may act as ""mild stress (or)"" or ""small irritant"" counteracting subsequent strong alcohol or stress procedure-induced severe lesions in this particular tissue.

This manuscript describes a novel hybrid nanoplatform comprising ultrathin catalytic platinum/gold (Pt/Au) nanotubes encapsulated with docetaxel and phase-change materials (PCMs) for the photoacoustic imaging-guided synergistic chemo-photothermal therapy of TNBC. Upon irradiation of near-infrared laser, the photothermal heating of nanotubes converts solid-state PCM into liquid, triggering the controlled release of the encapsulated docetaxel. The thin Pt layer within nanotubes enhances the nanotube's thermal stability, thus prolonging the photothermal ablation of tumors. Furthermore, platinum effectively mitigates tumor hypoxia by catalyzing the decomposition of hydrogen peroxides to generate oxygen in the tumor microenvironment, thus improving the efficiency of chemotherapy. It is demonstrated that the drug-loaded nanotubes achieve significant tumor inhibition rates of 75.4% in vivo on 4T1 tumor-bearing mice, significantly surpassing control groups. These nanotubes also notably extend survival, attributable to the synergistic effects of prolonged photothermal therapy facilitated by platinum and oxygenation-enhanced chemotherapy. This combination leverages the unique properties of the Pt/Au NTs-DTX/PCM nanoplatform, optimizing therapeutic outcomes.

Nanosomal docetaxel lipid suspension (NDLS) is a novel formulation developed to overcome toxicity issues caused by excipients (polysorbate 80 and ethanol) present in commercially available docetaxel formulation. We conducted a prospective, observational study to compare the outcomes of nanosomal docetaxel lipid suspension (NDLS)-based versus conventional docetaxel-based chemotherapy in primary operable breast cancer.


Methods
Sixty adult women with newly diagnosed stage IIb-III breast cancer were included. Patients received NDLS-based (n=30) or docetaxel-based (n=30) chemotherapy. Patients received (1) four cycles of preoperative doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by four cycles of NDLS or docetaxel (T) and surgery (neoadjuvant AC→NDLS [n=9], or neoadjuvant AC→T [n=10]), or (2) four cycles of preoperative AC followed by surgery and postoperative NDLS or T (neoadjuvant AC→adjuvant NDLS [n=14], or neoadjuvant AC→adjuvant T [n=15]), or (3) surgery followed by postoperative AC→NDLS or T (adjuvant AC→NDLS [n=7], or adjuvant AC→T [n=5]) regimens. The study outcomes were pathological complete response (pCR) rates, clinical overall response rates (ORR), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse event (AE) profile.


Results
For neoadjuvant AC→T (n=10) vs neoadjuvant AC→NDLS (n=9), the pCR rates were 100% each, and the ORR were 100% vs 88.9% (p=1.0). All patients were alive at 6 months, and the median OS was not reached. Three patients had progressive disease (T: n=2, NDLS: n=1) with a DFS of 12 weeks in all three patients. Grade 3 infusion-related reactions were seen in five patients (16.7%) in T vs none in NDLS arms.


Conclusion
NDLS-based neo/adjuvant chemotherapy was efficacious in the treatment of primary operable breast cancer and showed comparable pCR, ORR, DFS and OS rates versus conventional docetaxel. NDLS was better tolerated than conventional docetaxel.",10.2147/OTT.S400824

Robust grafting poly(ethylene glycol) monomethacrylate (PEGMA) comb-like brushes were established onto WCS NPs modified with hydrophobic deoxycholic acid (DC) using two aqueous solution systems, i.e., pure water and water/ethanol. The degree of grafting (DG) of the robust grafted poly(PEGMA) segments was varied from 0 to ~250% by varying radiation-absorbed doses from 0 to 30 kGy. Using reactive WCS NPs as a water-soluble polymeric template, a high amount of DC conjugation and a high degree of poly(PEGMA) grafted segments brought about high moieties of hydrophobic DC and a high DG of the poly(PEGMA) hydrophilic functions; meanwhile, the water solubility and NP dispersion were also markedly improved. The DC-WCS-PG building block was excellently self-assembled into the core-shell nanoarchitecture. The DC-WCS-PG NPs efficiently encapsulated water-insoluble anticancer and antifungal drugs, i.e., paclitaxel (PTX) and berberine (BBR) (~360 mg/g). The DC-WCS-PG NPs met the role of controlled release with a pH-responsive function due to WCS compartments, and they showed a steady state for maintaining drugs for up to >10 days. The DC-WCS-PG NPs prolonged the inhibition capacity of BBR against the growth of S. ampelinum for 30 days. In vitro cytotoxicity results of the PTX-loaded DC-WCS-PG NPs with human breast cancer cells and human skin fibroblast cells proved the role of the DC-WCS-PG NPs as a promising nanoplatform for controlling drug release and reducing the side effects of the drugs on normal cells.",10.3390/pharmaceutics15030847
"The physiological activity of Ginger is attributed to its functional components, including Gingerol and shogaol, and their derivatives",Ginger,Gingerol,Component-Whole,component-whole,Anti-inflammatory effect and signaling mechanism of 8-shogaol and 10-shogaol in a dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis mouse model.,"Ethnopharmacological relevance
Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) has been used for food and applied in Ayurvedic medicine in India for thousands of years. With a reputation for strong anti-inflammatory properties, it has been used for to treat colds, migraines, nausea, arthritis, and high blood pressure in China and Southeast Asia. The physiological activity of ginger is attributed to its functional components, including gingerol and shogaol, and their derivatives.


Aim of the study
We aimed to investigate the effects of 8- and 10-shogaol and their bioactive signaling mechanisms in a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. The anti-colitis efficacy of 6-, 8-, and 10-derivatives of gingerol and shogaol was comparatively analyzed.


Materials and methods
Colitis was induced by providing mice with drinking water containing 5% DSS (w/v) for 8 days. The 6-, 8-, and 10-derivatives of gingerol and shogaol were orally administered for two weeks at a dose of 30 mg/kg. Changes in body weight and disease activity index were measured. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, iNOS and COX-2, as well as the phosphorylation of NF-κB were analyzed using ELISA, PCR, or western blotting. Mucin expression and mRNA levels were measured using alcian blue staining and PCR, respectively. The tight-junction-associated proteins occludin and ZO-1 were assessed using immunohistological staining.


Results
The 6-, 8-, and 10-derivatives of gingerol and shogaol exhibited anti-inflammatory effects by regulating NF-κB signaling. Among the compounds administered, 10-shogaol was the most effective against DSS-induced inflammation. Comparative analysis of the chemical structure showed that shogaol, a dehydrated analog of gingerol, was more effective. 6- and 10-shogaol showed similar effects on DSS-induced morphological changes in the colonic mucus layer, mucin expression, and tight junction proteins.


Conclusions
6-, 8-, and 10-Gingerol and 6-, 8-, and 10-shogaol significantly improved the clinical symptoms and intestinal epithelial barrier damage in DSS-induced colitis in mice. The derivatives effectively inhibited DSS-induced inflammation through the regulation of NF-κB signaling. Moreover, 10-shogaol showed the most potent anti-inflammatory effect among the six compounds used in this study. The results indicate that 8- and 10-shogaol, both main ingredients in ginger, may serve as therapeutic candidates for the treatment of colitis.",10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e12778

Although a variety of diseases can be alleviated by TB, its ability to treat ulcerative colitis (UC) is still worth exploring. A dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic UC mouse model was designed to first explore the alleviatory effect of FBTB on UC and its underlying mechanism by the sequencing of fecal 16S rRNA genes, metabolomics, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Administration of FBTB at 400 mg/kg bw in DSS-damaged mice could effectively reduce colonic damage and inflammation and improve colonic antioxidant capacity to relieve the UC-caused symptoms. FBTB could correct the disrupted gut microbiota caused by UC and contribute to the proliferation of Lactobacillus and Parasutterella. FMT in combination with antibiotic treatment showed that FBTB could elevate the levels of microbial tryptophan metabolites, including indole-3-acetaldehyde (IAld) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), by selectively promoting the growth of Lactobacillus. Importantly, FBTB-elevated IAld and IAA could activate aromatic hydrocarbon receptors (AhRs) and enhance interleukin-22 production to repair the intestinal barrier. These findings demonstrated that FBTB alleviated UC mainly by targeting the gut microbiota involved in the AhR pathway for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of UC.",10.1021/acs.jafc.2c06821

For instance, the administration of Baitouweng decoction (BTWD) has proven effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. However, the limited understanding of its pharmacokinetics (PK) has impeded its widespread use. Chinese Bama miniature pigs possess anatomical and physiological similarities to the human body, making them a valuable model for investigating PK properties. Consequently, the identification of PK properties in Bama miniature pigs can provide valuable insights for guiding the clinical application of BTWD in humans. To facilitate this research, a rapid and sensitive UPLC-MS/MS method has been developed for the simultaneous quantification of eleven active ingredients of BTWD in plasma. Chromatographic separation was conducted using an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 C18 column and a gradient mobile phase comprising acetonitrile and water (containing 0.1% acetic acid). The methodology was validated in accordance with the FDA Bioanalytical Method Validation Guidance for Industry. The lower limit of quantitation fell within the range of 0.60-2.01 ng/mL. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that coptisine chloride, berberine, columbamine, phellodendrine, and obacunone exhibited low Cmax, while fraxetin, esculin, fraxin, and pulchinenoside B4 were rapidly absorbed and eliminated from the plasma. These findings have implications for the development of effective components in BTWD and the adjustment of clinical dosage regimens.",10.1155/2024/5535752

However, the role of GRK2 in the pathophysiology of ulcerative colitis (UC) remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of GRK2 in macrophage polarization in UC, using biopsies from patients, a GRK2 heterozygous mouse model with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, and THP-1 cells. The results showed that a high level of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) stimulated the receptor EP4 and enhanced the transmembrane activity of GRK2 in colonic lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs), resulting in a down-regulation of membrane EP4 expression. Then, the suppression of cAMP-cyclic AMP responsive element-binding (CREB) signal inhibited M2 polarization in UC. Paroxetine is acknowledged as one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), which is also considered as a potent GRK2 inhibitor with a high selectivity for GRK2. We found that paroxetine could alleviate symptoms of DSS-induced colitis in mice by regulating GPCR signaling to affect macrophage polarization. Taken together, the current results show that GRK2 may act as a novel therapeutic target in UC by regulating macrophage polarization, and paroxetine as a GRK2 inhibitor may have therapeutic effect on mice with DSS-induced colitis.",10.3390/ph16050664

With a novel approach, a series of porous manganese-iron PB (MnPB) colloids, which are shown to be efficient scavengers for reactive oxygen species (ROS) including hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion, and hydrogen peroxide, are prepared. In vitro cellular experiments confirm the capability of the nanozyme to protect cells from ROS attack. In vivo, the administration of MnPB nanozyme through gavage at a dosage of 10 mg kg-1 per day for three doses in total potently ameliorates the pathological symptoms of acute UC in a murine model, resulting in mitigated inflammatory responses and improved viability rate. Significantly, the nanozyme produced at a large scale can be achieved at an unprecedented yield weighting ≈11 g per batch of reaction, demonstrating comparable anti-ROS activities and treatment efficacy to its small-scale counterpart.

Additionally, the cyst wall of bradyzoites, that shields the persistent form responsible for chronic infection from the immune system, is heavily glycosylated. Formation of glycoconjugates relies on activated sugar nucleotides, such as uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). The glucosamine-phosphate-N-acetyltransferase (GNA1) generates N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate critical to produce UDP-GlcNAc. Here, we demonstrate that downregulation of T. gondii GNA1 results in a severe reduction of UDP-GlcNAc and a concomitant drop in glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs), leading to impairment of the parasite's ability to invade and replicate in the host cell. Surprisingly, attempts to rescue this defect through exogenous GlcNAc supplementation fail to completely restore these vital functions. In depth metabolomic analyses elucidate diverse causes underlying the failed rescue: utilization of GlcNAc is inefficient under glucose-replete conditions and fails to restore UDP-GlcNAc levels in GNA1-depleted parasites. In contrast, GlcNAc-supplementation under glucose-deplete conditions fully restores UDP-GlcNAc levels but fails to rescue the defects associated with GNA1 depletion. Our results underscore the importance of glucosamine-6-phosphate acetylation in governing T. gondii replication and invasion and highlight the potential of the evolutionary divergent GNA1 in Apicomplexa as a target for the development of much-needed new therapeutic strategies.",10.1371/journal.ppat.1011979

There is intense controversy about the heavy metal pollution in Burullus water and its effects on fish health and safety for human consumption. Heavy metals represent a major concern for aquatic life and could negatively affect fish health. Agricultural and industrial water drainage represents a considerable part of the lake water supply. The present work was conducted to determine heavy metal concentrations in lake water and blue tilapia Oreochromis aureus musculature. Water samples were collected from six locations to determine cadmium, copper, lead, zinc and iron. Sixty O. aureus fish samples were also collected from the same sampling points to assess the prevalent parasites infesting fish and to determine the heavy metal (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn and Fe) concentrations in fish musculature then study the relationship between heavy metals concentration and prevailing fish parasites. Results indicated that 53.34% of the examined fish were infested with encysted metacercaria. Centrocestus formosanus, Prohemistomum vivax, and Euclinostomum heterostomum were retrieved from gills, musculature, hepatopancreas and the posterior kidney. The parasitic intensity in fish tissues was between 1 and 9 cyst g-1. Centrocestus formosanus was identified using the polymerase chain reaction in the gill tissues of 16 fish. The gill parasitic copepod Lamproglena monodi was identified in one fish. Degenerative changes such as thickening, corrugation, and destruction of gill filament are the most dominant pathological changes in infested fish gills. Heavy metal concentrations in water samples were at normal levels, except for copper and iron in the southern part of the lake. All heavy metals in fish musculature were below the permissible limits. The parasitic infestation was more dominant in the northern part of the lake than in the southern region; this could be due to elevated copper concentration in the southern part of the lake that could negatively affect the survival of the first intermediate host and parasite cercaria.

"Water samples were collected from six locations to determine cadmium, Copper, lead, Zinc and iron",Copper,Zinc,Cause-Effect,component-whole,Prevailing parasitic diseases affecting Oreochromis aureus in Lake Burullus.,"Lake Burullus is an important source of fish production in Egypt; it produces 20.5% of the Egyptian fisheries' production. There is intense controversy about the heavy metal pollution in Burullus water and its effects on fish health and safety for human consumption. Heavy metals represent a major concern for aquatic life and could negatively affect fish health. Agricultural and industrial water drainage represents a considerable part of the lake water supply. The present work was conducted to determine heavy metal concentrations in lake water and blue tilapia Oreochromis aureus musculature.

"Additionally, we demonstrate that Yeast pgm2Δ cell lysates expressing the two Pneumocystis pgm2 transcripts individually can restore PGM activities significantly altered in the Yeast pgm2Δ strain",demonstrate that Yeast,in the Yeast,Component-Whole,component-whole,Characterization of the Pneumocystis jirovecii and Pneumocystis murina phosphoglucomutases (Pgm2s): a potential target for Pneumocystis therapy.,"Pneumocystis cyst life forms contain abundant β-glucan carbohydrates, synthesized using β-1,3 and β-1,6 glucan synthase enzymes and the donor uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose. In yeast, phosphoglucomutase (PGM) plays a crucial role in carbohydrate metabolism by interconverting glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate, a vital step in UDP pools for β-glucan cell wall formation. This pathway has not yet been defined in Pneumocystis. Herein, we surveyed the Pneumocystis jirovecii and Pneumocystis murina genomes, which predicted a homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae major PGM enzyme. Furthermore, we show that PjPgm2p and PmPgm2p function similarly to the yeast counterpart. When both Pneumocystis pgm2 homologs are heterologously expressed in S. cerevisiae pgm2Δ cells, both genes can restore growth and sedimentation rates to wild-type levels. Additionally, we demonstrate that yeast pgm2Δ cell lysates expressing the two Pneumocystis pgm2 transcripts individually can restore PGM activities significantly altered in the yeast pgm2Δ strain. The addition of lithium, a competitive inhibitor of yeast PGM activity, significantly reduces PGM activity. Next, we tested the effects of lithium on P. murina viability ex vivo and found the compound displays significant anti-Pneumocystis activity. Finally, we demonstrate that a para-aryl derivative (ISFP10) with known inhibitory activity against the Aspergillus fumigatus PGM protein and exhibiting 50-fold selectivity over the human PGM enzyme homolog can also significantly reduce Pmpgm2 activity in vitro. Collectively, our data genetically and functionally validate phosphoglucomutases in both P. jirovecii and P. murina and suggest the potential of this protein as a selective therapeutic target for individuals with Pneumocystis pneumonia.",10.1128/aac.00756-23
Soybean (Glycine max) contains two major TI classes: Kunitz Trypsin inhibitor (KTI) and Bowman-Birk inhibitor (BBI),Glycine,Trypsin,Component-Whole,component-whole,Overexpression of soybean trypsin inhibitor genes decreases defoliation by corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea) in soybean (Glycine max) and Arabidopsis thaliana.,"Trypsin inhibitors (TIs) are widely distributed in plants and are known to play a protective role against herbivores. TIs reduce the biological activity of trypsin, an enzyme involved in the breakdown of many different proteins, by inhibiting the activation and catalytic reactions of proteins. Soybean (Glycine max) contains two major TI classes: Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (KTI) and Bowman-Birk inhibitor (BBI). Both genes encoding TI inactivate trypsin and chymotrypsin enzymes, which are the main digestive enzymes in the gut fluids of Lepidopteran larvae feeding on soybean. In this study, the possible role of soybean TIs in plant defense against insects and nematodes was investigated. A total of six TIs were tested, including three known soybean trypsin inhibitors (KTI1, KTI2 and KTI3) and three genes encoding novel inhibitors identified in soybean (KTI5, KTI7, and BBI5). Their functional role was further examined by overexpression of the individual TI genes in soybean and Arabidopsis. The endogenous expression patterns of these TI genes varied among soybean tissues, including leaf, stem, seed, and root. In vitro enzyme inhibitory assays showed significant increase in trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitory activities in both transgenic soybean and Arabidopsis. Detached leaf-punch feeding bioassays detected significant reduction in corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea) larval weight when larvae fed on transgenic soybean and Arabidopsis lines, with the greatest reduction observed in KTI7 and BBI5 overexpressing lines. Whole soybean plant greenhouse feeding bioassays with H. zea on KTI7 and BBI5 overexpressing lines resulted in significantly reduced leaf defoliation compared to non-transgenic plants. However, bioassays of KTI7 and BBI5 overexpressing lines with soybean cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines) showed no differences in SCN female index between transgenic and non-transgenic control plants. There were no significant differences in growth and productivity between transgenic and non-transgenic plants grown in the absence of herbivores to full maturity under greenhouse conditions. The present study provides further insight into the potential applications of TI genes for insect resistance improvement in plants.",10.3389/fpls.2023.1129454

When HM levels in agricultural soils get to dangerous levels, it harms crop health and yield. Chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) are the main heavy metals. The environment contains these metals in varying degrees, such as in soil, food, water, and even the air. These substances damage plants and alter soil characteristics, which lowers crop yield. Crop types, growing circumstances, elemental toxicity, developmental stage, soil physical and chemical properties, and the presence and bioavailability of heavy metals (HMs) in the soil solution are some of the factors affecting the amount of HM toxicity in crops. By interfering with the normal structure and function of cellular components, HMs can impede various metabolic and developmental processes. Humans are exposed to numerous serious diseases by consuming these affected plant products. Exposure to certain metals can harm the kidneys, brain, intestines, lungs, liver, and other organs of the human body. This review assesses (1) contamination of heavy metals in soils through different sources, like anthropogenic and natural; (2) the effect on microorganisms and the chemical and physical properties of soil; (3) the effect on plants as well as crop production; and (4) entering the food chain and associated hazards to human health. Lastly, we identified certain research gaps and suggested further study.

We believe this to be caused by Water containing 0.78 mg/L of total Chlorine,Water,Chlorine,Component-Whole,component-whole,Methemoglobinemia in Hemodialysis Patients due to Acute Chlorine Intoxication: A Case Series Calling Attention on an Old Problem.,"INTRODUCTION
Hemodialysis uses municipal water that must be strictly purified and sterilized to be used for that procedure. Large amounts of decontaminants are often used, such as chlorine, and if these compounds are not subsequently removed they can be transferred to the blood of patients causing complications including methemoglobinemia.


METHODS
In this case series study, dialysis patients in one unit were evaluated. We reviewed clinical characteristics and laboratory findings obtained on the day when the water supply was disinfected with chlorine, with the aim to quantify methemoglobin concentrations. Our objective was to characterize the clinical presentation and management of patients who presented with methemoglobinemia on a specific index day. We also reviewed reported cases in the literature regarding this underreported complication.


RESULTS
Eight patients who presented with chlorine intoxication were evaluated. The methemoglobin concentrations were between 1.3% and 7.9% (reference value 0-1%). We believe this to be caused by water containing 0.78 mg/L of total chlorine. Seven patients presented with cyanosis, 4 with dizziness, 6 with dark brown blood, 4 with dyspnea, and 4 with headache and hemolytic anemia. Subjects were treated with supplemental oxygen, methylene blue, intravenous vitamin C, blood transfusions, and increased doses of erythropoietin. No patient died, and all continued with their usual hemodialysis sessions.


CONCLUSION
Acute chlorine intoxication transferred by the water used during hemodialysis sessions can present with methemoglobinemia accompanied by cyanosis, oxygen desaturation, and hemolytic anemia. Chlorine levels should be carefully monitored in the water used for hemodialysis treatment.",10.1159/000531952
"Cefazolin was administered in 561 elbows (90%) and non-cefazolin antibiotics including Vancomycin (32 elbows, 5%), clindamycin (27 elbows, 4%), and piperacillin/tazobactam (2 elbows, 0.3%) were administered in the remaining 61 elbows (10%)",Cefazolin,Vancomycin,Component-Whole,cause-effect,Non-cefazolin antibiotic prophylaxis is associated with higher rates of elbow periprosthetic joint infection.,"BACKGROUND
Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a common source of failure following elbow arthroplasty. Perioperative prophylactic antibiotics are considered standard of care. However, there are no data regarding the comparative efficacy of various antibiotics in the prevention of PJI for elbow arthroplasty. Previous studies in shoulder, hip, and knee arthroplasty have demonstrated higher rates of PJI with administration of non-cefazolin antibiotics. The elbow has higher rates of PJI than other joints. Therefore, this study evaluated whether perioperative antibiotic choice affects rates of PJI in elbow arthroplasty.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A single-institution, prospectively collected total joint registry database was queried to identify patients who underwent primary elbow arthroplasty between 2003 and 2021. Elbows with known infection prior to arthroplasty (25) and procedures with incomplete perioperative antibiotic data (7) were excluded, for a final sample size of 603 total elbow arthroplasties and 19 distal humerus hemiarthroplasties. Cefazolin was administered in 561 elbows (90%) and non-cefazolin antibiotics including vancomycin (32 elbows, 5%), clindamycin (27 elbows, 4%), and piperacillin/tazobactam (2 elbows, 0.3%) were administered in the remaining 61 elbows (10%). Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine the association between the antibiotic administered and the development of PJI. Infection-free survivorship was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.


RESULTS
Deep infection occurred in 47 elbows (7.5%), and 16 elbows (2.5%) were diagnosed with superficial infections. Univariate analysis demonstrated that patients receiving non-cefazolin alternatives were at significantly higher risk for any infection (hazard ratio [HR] 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-5.0; P < .01) and deep infection (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.3-5.5; P < .01) compared with cefazolin administration. Multivariable analysis, controlling for several independent predictors of PJI (tobacco use, male sex, surgical indication other than osteoarthritis, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score), showed that non-cefazolin administration had a higher risk for any infection (HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.4-5.3; P < .01) and deep infection (HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.3-6.3; P < .01). Survivorship free of infection was significantly higher at all time points for the cefazolin cohort.


DISCUSSION
In primary elbow arthroplasty, cefazolin administration was associated with significantly lower rates of PJI compared to non-cefazolin antibiotics, even in patients with a greater number of prior surgeries, which is known to increase the risk of PJI. For patients with penicillin or cephalosporin allergies, preoperative allergy testing or a cefazolin test dose should be considered before administering non-cefazolin alternatives.",10.1016/j.jse.2023.10.029
"RESULTS
In the base case, Cenobamate led to cost savings of £51 967 (compared to Brivaracetam), £21 080 (compared to eslicarbazepine), £33 619 (compared to lacosamide), and £28 296 (compared to perampanel) and increased QALYs of 1.047 (compared to brivaracetam), 0.598 (compared to eslicarbazepine), 0.776 (compared to lacosamide), and 0.703 (compared to perampanel) per individual over a lifetime time horizon",Cenobamate,Brivaracetam,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Cost-effectiveness of cenobamate for focal seizures in people with drug-resistant epilepsy.,"OBJECTIVE
This study was undertaken to estimate the cost-effectiveness of add-on cenobamate in the UK when used to treat drug-resistant focal seizures in adults who are not adequately controlled with at least two prior antiseizure medications, including at least one used adjunctively.


METHODS
We estimated the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for cenobamate compared to brivaracetam, eslicarbazepine, lacosamide, and perampanel in the UK National Health Service over a lifetime time horizon. We used a Markov cohort structure to determine response to treatment, using pooled data from three long-term studies of cenobamate. A network meta-analysis informed the likelihood of response to therapy with brivaracetam, eslicarbazepine, lacosamide, and perampanel relative to cenobamate. Once individuals discontinued treatment, they transitioned to subsequent treatment health states, including other antiseizure medicines, surgery, and vagus nerve stimulation. Costs included treatment, administration, routine monitoring, event management, and adverse events. Published evidence and expert opinion informed the likelihood of response to subsequent treatments, associated adverse events, and costs. Utility data were based on Short-Form six-dimension form utility. Discounting was applied at 3.5% per annum as per National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance. Uncertainty was explored through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.


RESULTS
In the base case, cenobamate led to cost savings of £51 967 (compared to brivaracetam), £21 080 (compared to eslicarbazepine), £33 619 (compared to lacosamide), and £28 296 (compared to perampanel) and increased QALYs of 1.047 (compared to brivaracetam), 0.598 (compared to eslicarbazepine), 0.776 (compared to lacosamide), and 0.703 (compared to perampanel) per individual over a lifetime time horizon. Cenobamate also dominated the four drugs across most sensitivity analyses. Differences were due to reduced seizure frequency with cenobamate relative to comparators.


SIGNIFICANCE
Cenobamate improved QALYs and was less costly than brivaracetam, eslicarbazepine, lacosamide, and perampanel. Therefore, cenobamate may be considered as a cost-effective adjunctive antiseizure medication for people with drug-resistant focal seizures.",10.1111/epi.17506

Protamine is a cationic protein rich in arginine that is used to treat the blood-brain barrier during excess heparin surgery. Trypsin is the most important digestive enzyme-encoding generated by the pancreas and can specifically cleave the carboxyl ends of arginine and lysine residues. Heparin, protamine, and trypsin interact and constrain each other, and their fluctuations reflect the body's dysfunction. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a fast, sensitive, and highly selective assay for regularly monitoring the levels of heparin, protamine, and trypsin in serum. Herein, a fluorescent and colorimetric dual-mode upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) biosensor was used for the determination of heparin, protamine, and trypsin based on the oxidase-mimicking activity of Ce4+ and electrostatic control. The biosensor exhibited sensitive detection of heparin, protamine, and trypsin with low limits of detection (LODs) of 16 ng/mL, 87 ng/mL and 31 ng/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the designed biosensor could eliminate autofluorescence, which not only effectively increased the accuracy of the sensor but also provided a new sensing pathway for the detection of differently charged biotargets.",10.1016/j.talanta.2024.126392

Moreover, they are the precursor of apocarotenoids, which include the phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA) and strigolactones (SLs) as well as retrograde signaling molecules and growth regulators, such as β-cyclocitral and zaxinone. Here, we show that the application of the volatile apocarotenoid β-ionone (β-I) to Arabidopsis plants at micromolar concentrations caused a global reprogramming of gene expression, affecting thousands of transcripts involved in stress tolerance, growth, hormone metabolism, pathogen defense, and photosynthesis. This transcriptional reprogramming changes, along with induced changes in the level of the phytohormones ABA, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid, led to enhanced Arabidopsis resistance to the widespread necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea (B.c.) that causes the gray mold disease in many crop species and spoilage of harvested fruits. Pre-treatment of tobacco and tomato plants with β-I followed by inoculation with B.c. confirmed the effect of β-I in increasing the resistance to this pathogen in crop plants. Moreover, we observed reduced susceptibility to B.c. in fruits of transgenic tomato plants overexpressing LYCOPENE β-CYCLASE, which contains elevated levels of endogenous β-I, providing a further evidence for its effect on B.c. infestation.

Drugs which can inhibit nausea/vomiting and/or increase gastric emptying are used to treat gastroparesis, mostly 'off-label'. Within each category, they act at different targets and modulate different physiological mechanisms.


AIMS
Address the questions: In gastroparesis, why should blocking one pathway causing vomiting, be more appropriate than another? Why might increasing gastric emptying via one mechanism be more appropriate than another?


METHODS
Drugs used clinically were identified via consensus opinions and reviews, excluding the poorly characterised. Their pharmacology was defined, mapped to mechanisms influencing vomiting and gastric emptying, and rationale developed for therapeutic use.


RESULTS
Vomiting: Rationale for 5-HT3 , D2 , H1 or muscarinic antagonists, and mirtazapine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, are poor. Arguments for inhibiting central consequences of vagal afferent transmission by NK1 antagonism are complicated by doubts over effects on nausea. Gastric emptying: Confusion emerges because of side-effects of drugs increasing gastric emptying: Metoclopramide (5-HT4 agonist, D2 and 5-HT3 antagonist; also blocks some emetic stimuli and causes tardive dyskinesia) and Erythromycin (high-efficacy motilin agonist, requiring low doses to minimise side-effects). Limited trials with selective 5-HT4 agonists indicate variable efficacy.


CONCLUSIONS
Several drug classes inhibiting vomiting have no scientific rationale. NK1 antagonism has rationale but complicated by limited efficacy against nausea. Studies must resolve variable efficacy of selective 5-HT4 agonists and apparent superiority over motilin agonists. Overall, lack of robust activity indicates a need for novel approaches targeting nausea (e.g., modulating gastric pacemaker or vagal activity, use of receptor agonists or new targets such as GDF15) and objective assessments of nausea.",10.1111/apt.17466
"METHODS
The current study is a double-blind controlled randomized clinical trial for 8 weeks, in which people with heart failure were randomly assigned to two groups: intervention (one capsule containing 20 mg of Astaxanthin per day, n = 40) and placebo (one capsule containing 20 mg of Maltodextrin per day, n = 40) will be divided",Astaxanthin,Maltodextrin,Component-Whole,component-whole,"The effect of astaxanthin supplementation on inflammatory markers, oxidative stress indices, lipid profile, uric acid level, blood pressure, endothelial function, quality of life, and disease symptoms in heart failure subjects.","BACKGROUND
Heart failure is a chronic and progressive disease where the heart muscle is unable to pump enough blood and oxygen to meet the body's needs. Oxidative stress and inflammation are key elements in the development and progression of heart failure. Astaxanthin, a carotenoid, has strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that may protect the cardiovascular system. A study will evaluate the effect of astaxanthin supplementation on inflammatory status, oxidative stress, lipid profile, uric acid levels, endothelial function, quality of life, and disease symptoms in people with heart failure.


METHODS
The current study is a double-blind controlled randomized clinical trial for 8 weeks, in which people with heart failure were randomly assigned to two groups: intervention (one capsule containing 20 mg of astaxanthin per day, n = 40) and placebo (one capsule containing 20 mg of maltodextrin per day, n = 40) will be divided. At the beginning and end of the intervention, uric acid, lipid profile, oxidative stress indices, inflammatory markers, blood pressure, nitric oxide, and anthropometric factors will be measured, and questionnaires measuring quality of life, fatigue intensity, shortness of breath, and appetite will be completed. SPSS version 22 software will be used for statistical analysis.


DISCUSSION
There is a growing global interest in natural and functional food products. This RCT contributes to the expanding body of research on the potential benefits of astaxanthin in heart failure patients, including its antioxidant, lipid-lowering, and anti-inflammatory effects.

"High Nitrate levels also led to specific gene expression patterns (e.g., polyamine metabolism), while other genes responded to inoculation regardless of Nitrogen supply conditions",Nitrate,Nitrogen,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Nitrogen Nutrition Modulates the Response to Alternaria brassicicola Infection via Metabolic Modifications in Arabidopsis Seedlings.,"Little is known about the effect of nitrogen nutrition on seedling susceptibility to seed-borne pathogens. We have previously shown that seedlings grown under high nitrate (5 mM) conditions are less susceptible than those grown under low nitrate (0.1 mM) and ammonium (5 mM) in the Arabidopsis-Alternaria brassicicola pathosystem. However, it is not known how seedling metabolism is modulated by nitrogen nutrition, nor what is its response to pathogen infection. Here, we addressed this question using the same pathosystem and nutritive conditions, examining germination kinetics, seedling development, but also shoot ion contents, metabolome, and selected gene expression. Nitrogen nutrition clearly altered the seedling metabolome. A similar metabolomic profile was observed in inoculated seedlings grown at high nitrate levels and in not inoculated-seedlings. High nitrate levels also led to specific gene expression patterns (e.g., polyamine metabolism), while other genes responded to inoculation regardless of nitrogen supply conditions. Furthermore, the metabolites best correlated with high disease symptoms were coumarate, tyrosine, hemicellulose sugars, and polyamines, and those associated with low symptoms were organic acids (tricarboxylic acid pathway, glycerate, shikimate), sugars derivatives and β-alanine. Overall, our results suggest that the beneficial effect of high nitrate nutrition on seedling susceptibility is likely due to nutritive and signaling mechanisms affecting developmental plant processes detrimental to the pathogen. In particular, it may be due to a constitutively high tryptophan metabolism, as well as down regulation of oxidative stress caused by polyamine catabolism.",10.3390/plants13040534
"Here, we report that feeding Arabidopsis thaliana with Ring-13 C-labeled Phenylalanine (13 C6 -Phe) resulted in incorporation of the 13 C label not into SA, but into its isomer 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA) instead",Phenylalanine,4-hydroxybenzoic acid,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Salicylic acid biosynthesis is not from phenylalanine in Arabidopsis.,"The phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) regulates biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants. Two distinct biosynthetic pathways for SA have been well documented in plants: the isochorismate (IC) pathway in the chloroplast and the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) pathway in the cytosol. However, there has been no solid evidence that the PAL pathway contributes to SA biosynthesis. Here, we report that feeding Arabidopsis thaliana with Ring-13 C-labeled phenylalanine (13 C6 -Phe) resulted in incorporation of the 13 C label not into SA, but into its isomer 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA) instead. We obtained similar results when feeding 13 C6 -Phe to the SA-deficient ics1 ics2 mutant and the SA-hyperaccumulating mutant s3h s5h. Notably, we detected 13 C6 -SA when 13 C6 -benzoic acid (BA) was provided, suggesting that SA can be synthesized from BA. Furthermore, despite the substantial accumulation of SA upon pathogen infection, we did not observe incorporation of 13 C label from Phe into SA. We also did not detect 13 C6 -SA in PAL-overexpressing lines in the kfb01 kfb02 kfb39 kfb50 background after being fed 13 C6 -Phe, although endogenous PAL levels were dramatically increased.

"Many cancer and activated immune cells (Warburg effect) or yeasts (Crabtree effect) mostly rely on aerobic glucose fermentation leading to lactate or Ethanol, respectively, to generate ATP",Ethanol,ATP,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Including glutamine in a resource allocation model of energy metabolism in cancer and yeast cells.,"Energy metabolism is crucial for all living cells, especially during fast growth or stress scenarios. Many cancer and activated immune cells (Warburg effect) or yeasts (Crabtree effect) mostly rely on aerobic glucose fermentation leading to lactate or ethanol, respectively, to generate ATP. In recent years, several mathematical models have been proposed to explain the Warburg effect on theoretical grounds. Besides glucose, glutamine is a very important substrate for eukaryotic cells-not only for biosynthesis, but also for energy metabolism. Here, we present a minimal constraint-based stoichiometric model for explaining both the classical Warburg effect and the experimentally observed respirofermentation of glutamine (WarburQ effect). We consider glucose and glutamine respiration as well as the respective fermentation pathways. Our resource allocation model calculates the ATP production rate, taking into account enzyme masses and, therefore, pathway costs. While our calculation predicts glucose fermentation to be a superior energy-generating pathway in human cells, different enzyme characteristics in yeasts reduce this advantage, in some cases to such an extent that glucose respiration is preferred. The latter is observed for the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, which is a known Crabtree-negative yeast. Further, optimization results show that glutamine is a valuable energy source and important substrate under glucose limitation, in addition to its role as a carbon and nitrogen source of biomass in eukaryotic cells. In conclusion, our model provides insights that glutamine is an underestimated fuel for eukaryotic cells during fast growth and infection scenarios and explains well the observed parallel respirofermentation of glucose and glutamine in several cell types.",10.1038/s41540-024-00393-x

Cadmium poisoning is mainly caused by inhalation of Cadmium dust or cadmium compound dust, which greatly harms people's lives",Cadmium,inhalation of Cadmium,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Effect of Tea Polyphenols on Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-related Factor 2 (NRF2) and Kelch-like ECH-associated Protein 1 (KEAP1) Gene Expression in Mice with Acute Cadmium Poisoning.,"Background
Cadmium poisoning is mainly caused by inhalation of cadmium dust or cadmium compound dust, which greatly harms people's lives. Tea polyphenols extracted from green tea have wide biological properties, including anti-cardiovascular disease, anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and immune regulation. The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) are involved in the regulation of cadmium-induced oxidative damage. However, whether tea polyphenols relieve acute cadmium poisoning via regulating NRF2 and KEAP1 gene expression remains unclear.


Objective
To explore the influences of tea polyphenols on NRF2 and KEAP1 gene expression in mice with acute cadmium poisoning.


Design
This is an animal experiment that adopts hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining.


Setting
This study was carried out in Zunyi Medical and Pharmaceutical College.


Participants
Fifty specific pathogen-free (SPF) male Kunming mice aged 9 weeks, weighing 18-22 g were divided into five groups: normal group, model group, low-dose tea polyphenols group, middle-dose tea polyphenols group, and high-dose tea polyphenols group.


Interventions
Tea polyphenols were administered intraastrically into mice with doses of 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, and 200 mg/kg for 10 consecutive days, respectively.


Observation indicators
(1) liver coefficient, (2) pathological liver injury, (3) liver function, (4) oxidative damage, and (5) NRF2 and KEAP1 gene expression.


Results
The liver coefficient, pathological liver injury, serum aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels of the model group were higher relative to the normal group (P < .05). Relative to the model group, different doses of tea polyphenols treatment significantly relieved liver coefficient, pathological liver injury, serum aspartate transaminase, and alanine transaminase levels (P < .05). Malondialdehyde content in liver tissues of the model group was significantly higher compared to the normal group, while glutathione together with glutathione peroxidase contents of the model group was lower (P < .05). Compared to the model group, malondialdehyde content in liver tissues declined while glutathione together with glutathione peroxidase contents were elevated after different doses of tea polyphenols treatment (P < .05). Relative to the normal group, NRF2 expression in the liver tissues of the model group was significantly lower, while KEAP1 expression was higher (P < .05). Relative to the model group, NRF2 expression in the liver tissues was elevated after treatment of different doses of tea polyphenols, while KEAP1 expression was declined (P < .05).


Conclusion
Tea polyphenols can relieve liver injury in mice with acute cadmium poisoning by regulating NRF2 and KEAP1 expression. Our study might provide a promising treatment strategy for acute cadmium poisoning.",
"This study aimed to enhance Water deficit resilience in sweet corn by applying foliar melatonin to four genotypes-Messenger, Dessert, Royalty, and Tyson under two levels of water deprivation induced by Polyethylene glycol at 8% and 12% concentrations in a hydroponic, controlled environment",Water,Polyethylene glycol,Component-Whole,cause-effect,Genotype-dependent resilience mediated by melatonin in sweet corn.,"BACKGROUND
Water deficits, exacerbated by climate change and unpredictable weather, have become a significant global challenge to agricultural productivity. In this context, exogenous melatonin treatment is well documented as a stress alleviator; however, its effects on various biological processes, particularly in less-explored genotypes, remain understudied. This study aimed to enhance water deficit resilience in sweet corn by applying foliar melatonin to four genotypes-Messenger, Dessert, Royalty, and Tyson under two levels of water deprivation induced by polyethylene glycol at 8% and 12% concentrations in a hydroponic, controlled environment.


RESULTS
The melatonin treatments were assessed for their impact on various morphological, physiological, and biochemical parameters under both normal and water-deficit conditions. Under severe water deprivation (12% PEG), melatonin increased root length by 75%, peroxidase activity by 31% while reducing malondialdehyde content by 34% in genotype Dessert indicating enhanced antioxidant defense and reduced oxidative damage. Likewise in genotype Royalty, stomatal conductance increased by 68%, with increasing specific area by 125% on melatonin treatment under severe water deprivation. The treatment also improved chlorophyll-a content by 93% in Royalty and 37% in Tyson, while decrease in malondialdehyde levels by 42% in Tyson, indicating reduced oxidative damage under severe water deprivation. In addition, melatonin increased photosystem II efficiency (Fv/Fm) in all genotypes with 27% increase in Royalty and improved quantum yield across all genotypes, regardless of the water deficit level.


CONCLUSION
Overall, melatonin treatment showed genotype-specific and dose-dependent effects in mitigating water deficit effects, offering a promising strategy to improve crop resilience and productivity in limited water environments. These results suggest the practical application for integrating melatonin treatments into sustainable agricultural practices, such as improving water deficit tolerance in sweet corn and potentially other crops, to maintain productivity under adverse climatic conditions.",10.1186/s12870-024-05972-y

In this study, both salt stress and drought stress induced mRNA levels of CONSTANS-like 1a (GmCOL1a) and stabilized the GmCOL1a protein. Transgenic 35S:GmCOL1a soybean plants exhibited enhanced salt and drought tolerance, with higher relative water content in leaves, greater proline content, lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and less reactive oxygen species (ROS) production compared with wild-type plants; the GmCOL1a knockout co-9 mutant showed opposite phenotypes. In addition, GmCOL1a promoted the expression of genes related to salt tolerance, effectively reducing the Na+/K+ ratio in soybean plants, especially in stems and leaves of 35S:GmCOL1a soybean. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis identified two potential direct targets of GmCOL1a, late embryogenesis abundant (GmLEA) and Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (GmP5CS) genes, which were verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), and transient transcriptional activation assays. GmCOL1a bound directly to the Myc(bHLH)-binding and Che-binding motifs of GmLEA and GmP5CS promoters to stimulate mRNA expression. Analysis of transgenic hairy-root GmP5CS:GmP5CS soybean plants in wild type, co-9, and 35S:GmCOL1a backgrounds further revealed that GmCOL1a enhances salt and drought tolerance by promoting GmP5CS protein accumulation in transgenic soybean hairy roots. Therefore, we demonstrate that GmCOL1a plays an important role in tolerance to abiotic stress in soybean.",10.1093/plphys/kiac573

However, the metabolic mechanism of PYS in tomato plants and the response mechanism of tomato to PYS are still lacking. In this study, it was found that tomato seedlings had a strong ability to absorb and translocate PYS from roots to shoots. The highest accumulation of PYS was in the apex tissue of the tomato shoots. Using UPLC-MS/MS, five metabolites of PYS were detected and identified in tomato plants, and their relative contents in different parts of tomato plants varied greatly. The serine conjugate, DMIT [5, 5-dimethyl-4, 5-dihydroisoxazole-3-thiol (DMIT)] &Ser, was the most abundant metabolites of PYS in tomato plants. In tomato plants, the conjugation of thiol-containing metabolic intermediates of PYS to serine may mimic the cystathionine β-synthase-catalyzed condensation of serine and homocysteine (in the pathway sly00260 sourced from KEGG database). This study ground breakingly proposed that serine may play an important role in plant metabolism of PYS and fluensulfone (whose molecular structure is similar to PYS). PYS and atrazine (whose toxicity profile is similar to PYS but not conjugate with serine) produced different regulatory outcomes for endogenous compounds in the pathway sly00260. Differential metabolites in tomato leaves exposed to PYS compared with the control, including amino acids, phosphates, and flavonoids, may play important roles in tomato response to PYS stress.

In this study, marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma), typically inhabiting 30‰ high salinity, were gradually acclimated to low salinities of 20, 10, and 0‰. Following acclimation, the fish were exposed to arsenate (As(V)) in their diet for 30 days. Results showed a significant accumulation of total arsenic (As) and AsB concentrations in the muscle and head tissues of the exposed fish, with these accumulations exhibiting a positive correlation with water salinity. Transcriptome analyses revealed that exposure to As(V) at low salinity may disrupt membrane components and induce cytoskeletal injuries, while at high salinity, it triggered oxidoreductase activity and transmembrane transport. Metabolome analyses indicated that low salinity induced osmotic stress, resulting in an increased requirement for amino acids to upload intracellular osmotic equilibrium in O. melastigma. Furthermore, the key organic osmolytes and amino acids, including taurine, l-methionine, guanidinoethyl sulfonate, and N-acetyl-l-aspartic acid, exhibited a negative correlation with the AsB concentration. These findings indicated that salinity can regulate osmotic balance by influencing amino acid synthesis under low salinity and stimulating AsB synthesis under high salinity conditions in O. melastigma.

"BACKGROUND
Compared with corn, Wheat contains higher crude protein, Amino acids concentration",Wheat,Amino acids,Component-Whole,component-whole,"The impact of different levels of wheat diets on hepatic oxidative stress, immune response, and lipid metabolism in Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries).","BACKGROUND
Compared with corn, wheat contains higher crude protein, amino acids concentration. However, wheat contains a mass of anti-nutritional factors, resulting in increased of the digesta viscosity and impaired the intestinal function in ruminant.


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to investigate the effects of substitution of different amounts of wheat for corn on hepatic metabolism in the Tibetan lamb.


METHODS
Ninety Tibetan lambs (Body weight = 12.37 ± 0.92 kg) were randomly assigned to three groups: 0% wheat diet (Control), 10% wheat diet (Low group), and 15% wheat diet (High group). The feeding trial lasted for 130 d, including a 10 d adaption period. Hepatic gene expression profiling was performed via RNA sequencing after the conclusion of the feeding trials.


RESULTS
Results showed that greater level of glutathione peroxidase levels in L group compared with those of the C and H groups (P < 0.05). The immune indexes, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and IgM were also elevated in L group compared with the other groups (P < 0.05). Compared with H group, the hepatocytes were arranged radially, and hepatic plates anastomosed with each other to form a labyrinth-like structure in L group. Transcriptomic analysis showed 872 differentially expressed genes (DEG) between H and L group, of which 755 were down-regulated and 117 were up-regulated. Through Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, 32 pathways were significantly enriched (Q-value < 0.05), such as the cAMP signaling pathway, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, leukocyte transendothelial migration, platelet activation and adipocytokine signaling pathway. Additionally, the expression of comment DEGs were verified via quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.


CONCLUSION
In summary, our findings suggest that wheat can be supplemented up to 10% in Tibetan sheep, contributing to improve the hepatic oxidative stress, immune response and lipid metabolism through regulating the expression of related genes.",10.1186/s12917-023-03874-z

This study investigated the accumulation of different polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs, i.e., plain PS, carboxyl-functional PS-COOH and amino-functional PS-NH2) at two particle sizes of 100 nm and 200 nm, and evaluated the impacts on oxidative stress, energy metabolism and mitochondrial pathway responses in intestine and respiratory tree of Apostichopus japonicus during the 20-d exposure experiment. The results showed that there were significant interactions of particle size and nanoplastic type on the accumulation of different PS-NPs. Exposure to NPs significantly increased the production of malondialdehyde, glutathione and reactive oxygen species, as well as the activities of antioxidant enzymes including glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase and catalase, resulting in various degrees of oxidative damage in sea cucumber. The significant decrease in adenosine triphosphate content and increases in alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase activities suggested that NPs impaired energy metabolism and modified their energy allocation. After 20-d exposure, the complex I, II and III activities in mitochondrial respiratory chain were significantly inhibited. Meanwhile, the Bax and Caspase-3 gene expression were significantly up-regulated, and Bacl-2 was down-regulated, indicating the toxicity on mitochondrial pathway of A. japonicus. The calculated IBR values elucidated the greater detriment to mitochondrial pathway than oxidative stress and energy metabolism. For 100 nm particle size, plain PS has stronger influence on all the biomarkers compared to PS-COOH/NH2, however, the opposite trends were observed in 200 nm PS-NPs. Furthermore, 100 nm PS-NPs were recognized to be more hazardous to sea cucumber than 200 nm microbeads. These findings provide new insights for understanding the differentiated toxic effects of functionalized NPs in marine invertebrates.",10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121015

Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) is a potential herb that can be used to reduce the level of oxidative stress. This study aimed to determine the effect of ginger on the expression of metabolites and their metabolic pathways in the myoblast cells to elucidate the mechanism involved and its pharmacological properties in promoting myoblast differentiation. (2) Methods: The myoblast cells were cultured into three stages (young, pre-senescent and senescent). At each stage, the myoblasts were treated with different concentrations of ginger extract. Then, metabolomic analysis was performed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS). (3) Results: Nine metabolites were decreased in both the pre-senescent and senescent control groups as compared to the young control group. For the young ginger-treated group, 8-shogaol and valine were upregulated, whereas adipic acid and bis (4-ethyl benzylidene) sorbitol were decreased. In the pre-senescent ginger-treated group, the niacinamide was upregulated, while carnitine and creatine were downregulated. Ginger treatment in the senescent group caused a significant upregulation in 8-shogaol, octadecanamide and uracil. (4) Conclusions: Ginger extract has the potential as a pharmacological agent to reduce muscle loss in skeletal muscle by triggering changes in some metabolites and their pathways that could promote muscle regeneration in ageing.",10.3390/nu15214520

MA1 during long-term acid stress.,"Algae plays a significant role for the primary production in the oligotrophic ecosystems such as the acid mine pit lakes. Graesiella sp. MA1 was a new acid-tolerant photosynthetic protist isolated from an acid mine pit lake. To understand the acid responses of Graesiella sp. MA1, its physiological changes and metabolomics were studied during long-term acid stress. Photosynthetic pigments, soluble proteins, and antioxidant systems of Graesiella sp. MA1 cells displayed two phases, the adaptation phase and the growth phase. During the adaptation phase, both photosynthetic pigments and soluble proteins were inhibited, while antioxidant activity of SOD, APX, and GSH were promoted to response to the organism's damage. Metabolomics results revealed lipids and organic acids were abundant components in Graesiella sp. MA1 cells. In response to acid stress, the levels of acid-dependent resistant amino acids, including glutamate, aspartate, arginine, proline, lysine, and histidine, accumulated continuously to maintain orderly intracellular metabolic processes. In addition, fatty acids were mainly unsaturated, which could improve the fluidity of the cell membranes under acid stress. Metabolomic and physiological changes showed that Graesiella sp.

However, the specific metabolic pathways that underlie these effects are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the metabolic pathways that are involved in the protective effects of moderate PA in non-obese and healthy individuals. Data on 305 young, non-obese participants were obtained from the Qatar Biobank. The participants were classified as active or sedentary based on their self-reported PA levels. Plasma metabolomics data were collected and analyzed to identify differences in metabolic pathways between the two groups. The results showed that active participants had increased activation of antioxidative, stress-related pathways, including lysoplasmalogen, plasmalogen, phosphatidylcholine, vitamin A, and glutathione. Additionally, there were significant associations between glutathione metabolites and certain clinical traits, including bilirubin, uric acid, hemoglobin, and iron.

However, little is known about the effect of downstream processing-induced stress on these systems. The aim of this study is to investigate the compaction properties of co-amorphous materials and their solid-state stability upon compaction. Model systems of co-amorphous materials consisting of carvedilol and the two co-formers aspartic acid and tryptophan were produced via spray drying. The solid state of matter was characterized using XRPD, DSC, and SEM. Co-amorphous tablets were produced with a compaction simulator, using varying amounts of MCC in the range of 24 to 95.5% (w/w) as a filler, and showed high compressibility. Higher contents of co-amorphous material led to an increase in the disintegration time; however, the tensile strength remained rather constant at around 3.8 MPa. No indication of recrystallization of the co-amorphous systems was observed.

This comparative study evaluated the comparative residual effects of iron nanoparticles (FNp) with two other Fe sources including iron-sulphate (FS) and iron-chelate (FC) on maize (Zea mays L.) crop grown under salt stress. All three Fe sources were applied at the rate of 15 and 25 mg/kg of soil before the sowing of wheat (an earlier crop; following the sequence of crop rotation) and no further Fe amendments were added later for the maize crop. Results revealed that FNp application at 25 mg/kg (FNp-2) substantially increased maize height, root length, root dry weight, shoot dry weight, and grain weightby 80.7%, 111.1%, 45.7%, 59.5%, and 77.2% respectively, as compared to the normal controls; and 62.6%, 81.3%, 65.1%, 78%, and 61.2% as compared to salt-stressed controls, respectively. The FNp-2 treatment gave higher activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase compared to salt stressed control (50.6%, 51%, 48.5%, and 49.2%, respectively). The FNp-2 treatment also produced more photosynthetic pigments and better physiological markers: higher chlorophyll a contents by 49.9%, chlorophyll b contents by 67.2%, carotenoids by 62.5%, total chlorophyll contents by 50.3%, membrane stability index by 59.1%, leaf water relative contents by 60.3% as compared to salt stressed control.

The results showed that nickel, lead, and copper stress caused a significant decrease in the contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and chlorophyll (a + b) in A. tauschii, thereby inhibiting photosynthesis to different degrees and hindering seedling growth, which was reflected in significant reductions in plant height and root length, with the most notable effect observed under stress by 300 mg·kg-1 lead. As the concentration of heavy metals increased, the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, and APX), non-enzymatic antioxidants (GSH and AsA), and the contents of osmotic regulatory substances (proline and soluble proteins) in A. tauschii significantly increased. Additionally, heavy metal stress increased H2O2 and TBARS levels. However, when the nickel, lead, and copper concentrations reached 300 mg·kg-1, no significant differences were found in H2O2 or TBARS levels compared to those in the CK group. To summarize, A. tauschii can mitigate the accumulation of ROS and membrane lipid peroxidation caused by heavy metal stress through self-regulation, thus exhibiting a certain degree of tolerance to stress caused by different concentrations of nickel, lead, and copper. Finally, the evaluation using the membership function method revealed that among the three heavy metals, A. tauschii exhibited the strongest adaptation to Cu, followed by Ni and Pb.",10.1038/s41598-024-77143-w

However, its accumulation represents a real environmental threat. Thus, its phytotoxic impact needs more consideration. Our study was conducted to highlight the phytotoxic effect of triclosan on the growth, ROS homeostasis, and detoxification metabolism of two different plant species i.e., legumes (Glycine max) and grass (Avena sativa). Moreover, we investigated the potentiality of plant growth-promoting bacteria (ST-PGPB) in mitigating the phytotoxic effect of triclosan. Triclosan induced biomass (fresh and dry weights) reduction in both plants, but to a higher extent in oats. This decline was associated with a noticeable increment in the oxidative damage (e.g., MDA and H2O2) and detoxification metabolites such as metallothionein (MTC), phytochelatins (PCs), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). This elevation was associated with a remarkable reduction in both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants. On the other hand, the bioactive strain of ST-PGPB, Salinicoccus sp. JzA1 significantly alleviated the harmful effect of triclosan on both soybean and oat plants by enhancing their biomass, photosynthesis, as well as levels of minerals (K, Ca, P, Mn, and Zn). In parallel, a striking quenching in oxidative damage and an obvious improvement in non-enzymatic (polyphenols, tocopherols, flavonoids) and enzymatic antioxidants were observed. Furthermore, Salinicoccus sp. JzA1 augmented the detoxification metabolism by enhancing the levels of phytochelatins, metallothionein, and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity in a species-specific manner which is more apparent in soybean rather than in oat plants. To this end, stress mitigating impact of Salinicoccus sp.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of biochar addition on the physicochemical properties of arid and semi-arid soils containing microplastics, while also assessing its effect on Barley (Hordeum vulgare) yield under drought stress. The experiment was conducted in a glass greenhouse. Plastic pots containing 3 kg of soil were each planted with 6 barley grains. Biochar was applied at three doses (B0 = 0 g biochar/kg soil, B1 = 6 g biochar/kg soil, B2 = 10 g biochar/kg soil), while microplastics were added at three levels (M0 = Control without microplastics, M1 = 0.5 g/kg soil, and M2 = 1 g/kg soil) on the same sowing date. Water stress was induced when the plants reached the four-leaf stage. ANOVAs and Tukey post-hoc tests were employed for multiple mean comparisons of soil and plant parameters. Drought stress and microplastics negatively influenced soil parameters namely soil moisture, organic carbon, and nitrates, while also affecting electrical conductivity and pH. Biochar exhibited minimal effect on soil properties but significantly altered pH, nitrates, and total CaCO3. Plant chlorophyll levels decreased under stress, particularly with microplastic dose M1. However, biochar and microplastics enhanced chlorophyll a content, except for dose B1 of biochar, which leads to a decrease in chlorophyll b (0.91 ± 0.138 μg/g FM). Microplastics, at dose M2, improved chlorophyll b content (1.11 ± 0.090 μg/g FM). Aboveground biomass, leaf area, and yield were generally unaffected by tested stresses. Nonetheless, barley grain yield decreased in biochar and microplastic dose M1 (0.47 ± 0.108 g/plant), while it improved with microplastic dose M2 (0.65 ± 0.168 g/plant). Leaf relative water content increased under water stress and microplastics but not with biochar alone. Interaction between microplastics and biochar enhanced plant water content. Drought stress and microplastics diminished soil parameters, whereas biochar lowered nitrates and pH without significantly affecting soil organic carbon. Plant productivity parameters generally exhibited no significant change under water stress, microplastics, or biochar, except for yield and chlorophyll pigments.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.143760

'Ruby Queen' and 'Scarlet Supreme') and white beet ('Rodeo' and 'Ansa') cultivars under increasing salinity levels of 50, 150, and 250 mM NaCl. Exogenous melatonin increased salinity-induced reductions in fresh and dry weights and osmotic potential in leaves. Na+ concentrations rose significantly with increasing salinity, but cultivar-specific decreases were observed in K+ and Ca2+ concentrations. Additionally, melatonin application improved betalain, betanin and neobetanin contents induced by salt stress. Furthermore, melatonin application caused salt stress and cultivar-specific changes in phenolic acid contents e.g., ferulic acid, sinapic acid, or m-coumaric acid, in soluble free, ester- and glycoside-conjugated and cell wall-bound forms. In addition, antioxidant enzyme activities and compound contents increased significantly in the beets and were subsequently lowered in a cultivar-specific manner by salt stress + melatonin treatment. The current findings indicate that exogenous melatonin improved plant stress tolerance suppressing reactive oxygen species levels, increasing the antioxidant enzyme activities and compound contents and reducing the levels of Na+, maintaining an ionic homeostasis in the selected red and white sugar beet cultivars. It appears that melatonin application may help improve cultivar-specific salt tolerance by enhancing ion homeostasis and betalain and phenolic acid production levels in beets.",10.1111/ppl.14611

Sodium chloride and polyethylene glycol 8000 were used to apply salinity and drought stresses at three levels each and achieve the results of seed coatings on reducing the effects of salinity and drought stresses. To determine the indices related to emergence and establishment, cultivation trays were utilized with four replications for each treatment. The trays were kept inside a greenhouse. Coating treatments significantly improved total germination percentage, germination rate, seedling growth, and uniformity compared with the non-treated controls. In all treatments, polyvinylpyrrolidone was utilized as a binder. The best treatment with respect to germination and seedling growth indices was number 21 (micro and macronutrients, humic acid, gibberellic acid) in salinity and drought stress conditions.

AFM and SEM images showed a compact, non-porous and homogenous morphology of the hybrid films, proving a good miscibility of the blends. At lower concentrations of embedded filler, the composites were less hardened and more ductile due to the interaction with the polymeric matrix. Increased amounts of inorganic NPs led to the reduced mechanical properties of the prepared materials and increased thermal stability. The bionanocomposites revealed a similar behavior of the dielectric constant with frequency and increased values at higher temperatures. The wettability of the films' surface and the values of the water sorption capacity revealed a slight hydrophilicity of the bionanocomposites as compared with the initial matrices.

"METHODS
Patients receiving UFH or low molecular weight Heparin (LMWH) were enrolled; aPTT and anti-factor Xa activity were tested using two different analyser/reagent pairs (Stago and reagent without Dextran sulfate; Siemens and reagent with dextran sulfate) after 1, 4 and 6 h of sample storage as whole blood or as plasma",Heparin,Dextran,Component-Whole,component-whole,Monitoring heparin therapy: stability of two different anti-Xa assays using blood samples collected in citrate-containing and CTAD tubes.,"BACKGROUND
Anti-factor Xa assays and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are mainly employed to monitor patients treated with heparins. According to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and the French Working Group on Haemostasis and Thrombosis, anti-factor Xa activity and aPTT should be tested within 2 h of blood sampling for unfractionated heparin (UFH) monitoring. However, discrepancies exist depending on the used reagents and collecting tubes. The study aim was to determine the stability of aPTT and anti-factor Xa measurements using blood samples collected in citrate-containing or citrate-theophylline-adenosine-dipyridamole (CTAD) tubes and stored for up to 6 h.


METHODS
Patients receiving UFH or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) were enrolled; aPTT and anti-factor Xa activity were tested using two different analyser/reagent pairs (Stago and reagent without dextran sulfate; Siemens and reagent with dextran sulfate) after 1, 4 and 6 h of sample storage as whole blood or as plasma.


RESULTS
For UFH monitoring, comparable anti-factor Xa activity and aPTT results were obtained with both analyser/reagent pairs when samples were stored as whole blood before plasma isolation. With samples stored as plasma, anti-factor Xa activity and aPTT were not affected up to 6 h after sampling when using the Stago/no-dextran sulfate reagent pair. With the Siemens/dextran sulfate-containing reagent, aPTT was significantly altered after 4 h of storage. For LMWH monitoring, anti-factor Xa activity remained stable (whole blood and plasma) for at least 6 h. Results were comparable with citrate-containing and CTAD tubes.


CONCLUSIONS
Anti-factor Xa activity in samples stored as whole blood or plasma was stable for up to 6 h, regardless of the reagent (with/without dextran sulfate)/collection tube. Conversely, aPTT was more variable because other plasma parameters can influence its measure and complicate the interpretation of its variations after 4 h.",10.1186/s12959-023-00465-8

The therapeutic efficacy of BX was evaluated by bone parameters (BMD, BV/TV, Tb.N, Tb.Sp), hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining results, and determination of bone formation markers procollagen type Ⅰ amino-terminal peptide (PⅠNP) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP). Serum and fecal metabolomics and high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing were performed to evaluate effects on endogenous metabolites and GM. In addition, an enzyme-based functional correlation algorithm (EBFC) algorithm was used to investigate functional correlations between GM and metabolites.


RESULTS
BX improved OP in OVX mice by increasing BMD, BV/TV, serum PⅠNP, BALP, and improving Tb.N and Tb.Sp. A total of 59 differential metabolites were identified, and 9 metabolic pathways, including arachidonic acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, purine metabolism, and tryptophan metabolism, were found to be involved in the progression of OP. EBFC analysis results revealed that the enzymes related to purine and tryptophan metabolism, which are from Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Blautia, Rs-E47_termite_group, UCG-009, and Clostridia_UCG-014, were identified as the intrinsic link between GM and metabolites.


CONCLUSIONS
The regulation of GM and restoration of metabolic disorders may be the mechanisms of action of BX in alleviating OP. This research provides insights into the function-oriented mechanism discovery of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of OP.",10.1016/j.jep.2024.118130
"Methods
Adults, who had relapsed after first complete course of a Sofosbuvir-containing first-line, pegylated interferon free, anti-HCV treatment regimen with or without Ribavirin (Riba) were included",Sofosbuvir,Ribavirin,Component-Whole,component-whole,Hepatitis C Retreatment With First-Line Direct Acting Antiviral Drugs.,"Background and Aims
Sofosbuvir (S), daclatasvir (D), ledipasvir, or velpatasvir (V) containing first-line hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment regimens fail to cure viremia in 5-10%. We report our experience of HCV retreatment using these first-line drugs, in a setting where second-line anti-HCV drugs are not available.


Methods
Adults, who had relapsed after first complete course of a sofosbuvir-containing first-line, pegylated interferon free, anti-HCV treatment regimen with or without ribavirin (Riba) were included. Retreatment regimen, tailored to the failed anti-HCV regimen, was based on principle of using first-line drugs for 24 weeks with ribavirin and swapping between pangenotypic and genotype-specific regimens. Retreatment outcome was categorized as successful (achieved undetectable HCV RNA at the end of treatment [ETR] and sustained viral response at week 12 [SVR12]), non-responder (failed to achieve ETR), or relapse (achieved ETR but not achieved SVR12).


Results
Twelve patients (9 male; 7 cirrhosis; all genotype 3) who had relapsed to prior anti-HCV treatment (4 SD12, 4 SD24, 1 SDRiba12, 1 SDRiba24, 2 SV12) were included. Following retreatment (2 SDRiba24, 10 SVRiba24), all achieved ETR but only 9 (75%) achieved SVR12. Two among three, in whom retreatment failed, achieved SVR12 following another course of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/ribavirin for 24 weeks. Overall, 11/12 (92%) patients achieved SVR12 following retreatment with the first-line anti-HCV drugs.


Conclusion
HCV retreatment could be a treatment option if second-line anti-HCV drugs are not available. Successful retreatment could be achieved, in a large proportion, with the use of first-line drugs for 24 weeks with ribavirin and swapping of pangenotypic/genotype-specific regimens (NCT03483987).",10.1016/j.jceh.2023.03.007
"The biological activities of Safflower, including its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, were enhanced through Yeast fermentation",Safflower,Yeast,Component-Whole,cause-effect,Preparation of safflower fermentation solution and study on its biological activity.,"Introduction
Safflower, a traditional Chinese medicine, is rich in chemical components including flavonoids, polysaccharides, and alkaloids. It exhibits pharmacological effects such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and anti-thrombosis properties, making it a valuable resource in the medical field. Furthermore, due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, safflower is increasingly being utilized in the cosmetics industry.


Methods
In this study, yeast was employed to ferment safflower, and the optimal fermentation conditions were established through single-factor experiments and response surface methodology. Subsequently, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacy of the safflower fermentation solution was assessed using both cellular and zebrafish models. Finally, the safety of the safflower fermentation solution was evaluated through a cosmetic eye irritation test.


Results
From a total of 20 yeast strains, YF-5 was identified as the dominant strain for safflower fermentation. By optimizing the fermentation conditions, it was established that the optimal parameters for YF-5 fermentation of safflower are as follows: a fermentation temperature of 36.55°C, a material-to-liquid ratio of 1:20.46, a fructose concentration of 6.20%, a fermentation duration of 72 h, and an inoculum volume of 4%. The biological activities of safflower, including its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, were enhanced through yeast fermentation. In HaCaT cell and zebrafish oxidative damage assays, safflower fermentation solution inhibits the production of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increases superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity as well as total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC). In the RAW264.7 cell inflammatory damage assays, a 20% safflower fermentation solution was found to inhibit the release of TNF-α and NO in the inflammatory model, with inhibition rates of 30.94 and 28.86%, respectively. In the zebrafish inflammatory damage assays, the quantity of fluorescent neutral proteins in the 5% safflower fermentation solution was 0.7 times that observed in the dexamethasone (0.1 mg/mL) positive control group, indicating that its anti-inflammatory activity is comparable to that of dexamethasone (0.1 mg/mL). In the chicken embryo chorionic membrane experiment, it was observed that the safflower fermentation solution did not cause significant damage to the blood vessels of the chorionic allantoic membrane (CAM). This finding demonstrates that the safflower fermentation solution possesses a certain degree of safety.


Discussion
Safflower fermentation solution has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory bioactivities, and it has passed cosmetic safety evaluations. It can be used as a new natural cosmetic ingredient added to cosmetic products.",10.3389/fmicb.2024.1472992
"Of the patients who received DOACs, 41 (67.21%) received Apixaban, one (1.64%) received Dabigatran, and 19 (31.15%) received rivaroxaban",Apixaban,Dabigatran,Component-Whole,component-whole,Efficacy and Safety of Direct Oral Anticoagulants Compared to Warfarin in Patients with Cirrhosis and Splanchnic Vein Thrombosis.,"OBJECTIVE
The incidence of splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is reported to be <25 times lower than that of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli, which occur in 70 to 270/100,000 cases in the general population. Current guidelines recommend initial treatment with therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin followed by a transition to a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) in patients with cirrhosis who develop SVT without severe liver dysfunction. This, however, is based on observational data. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anticoagulant therapy in patients with cirrhosis who present with SVT and receive either a DOAC or a VKA.


METHODS
This multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted from December 2021 to November 2022. Patients between the ages of 18 and 75 years with cirrhosis and acute SVT who received either a VKA or a DOAC between July 2019 and July 2021 were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was the efficacy of treatment, defined as a new thrombotic event. The secondary outcome was the safety of treatment, defined as the development of major bleeding. Readmission data were followed up at 6 and 10 months. Bivariate analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between the medication groups and each outcome and summarized as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical significance was set at 5% for all of the comparisons.


RESULTS
A total of 80 patients from 50 hospitals were included in this study. Sixty-one patients (59.02% male) received DOACs and 19 (57.89% male) received a VKA. Of the patients who received DOACs, 41 (67.21%) received apixaban, one (1.64%) received dabigatran, and 19 (31.15%) received rivaroxaban. The results from the bivariate analysis revealed no significant differences between DOACs and warfarin for both the efficacy (OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.44-4.84, P = 0.53) and safety outcomes (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.04-26.43, P = 1) at 10 months.


CONCLUSIONS
The use of DOACs in patients with cirrhosis who present with SVT may be efficacious and safe compared with warfarin. The findings from our study may inform power analyses for well-conducted randomized trials to confirm these findings.",10.14423/SMJ.0000000000001750

In this study, the result suggested that ToLCNDV-potato significantly (p < 0.01) affected the morphological parameters and photosynthetic pigment system in both the cultivars of potato, viz., Kufri Pukhraj (susceptible) and Kufri Bahar (tolerant). However, the impact of ToLCNDV-potato was lower in Kufri Bahar. Moreover, the viral infection in potato showed significant (p < 0.01) enhancement in the leakage of plant oxidative metabolites such as proline and malondialdehyde (MDA) which was further confirmed with higher electrolyte leakage. The viral infection imbalance of starch metabolism in the leaves ultimately affects the carbohydrate profile. ToLCNDV-potato significantly lowered starch synthesis, enhanced the accumulation of sucrose, glucose, fructose and-which was further validated by enzymatic estimation of β-amylase-α-amylase and phosphorylase activity in the leaves of both cultivars. The antioxidant enzymes, viz., catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase, were reported to be enhanced in both the cultivars due to ToLCNDV-potato infection. The higher enhancement of antioxidant enzyme activity was observed in Kufri Bahar, which signifies its resistant attributes. These findings in the potato plant broaden our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of starch metabolism and antioxidant activity and provide proof of concept for breeding potato for ToLCNDV-potato tolerance.",10.3390/antiox12071447

"Ontario pharmacists expressed a preference for scheduling change for five drugs (four prescription [terconazole for intravaginal use, famotidine, rupatadine, Mometasone nasal spray] and one unscheduled [Ranitidine 75 mg]), while Québec pharmacists expressed preference for scheduling change for three prescription drugs (terconazole for intravaginal use, famotidine, rupatadine)",Mometasone,Ranitidine,Component-Whole,component-whole,Survey of community pharmacists' opinions on drug scheduling in Ontario and Québec.,"Background
Over the past decade, Canada has witnessed a shift of several drugs from prescription-only to behind-the-counter (BTC) and over-the-counter (OTC) status. This work examined community pharmacists' agreement with the current scheduling of agents used in the management of allergic rhinitis, heartburn, and vulvovaginitis.


Methods
From September to October 2022, an online survey was administered to pharmacists practicing in in Ontario and Québec. The survey aimed to gather insights into their preferred scheduling for 15 medicines commonly used to manage the three selected conditions. Pharmacists were asked whether they agreed with the current scheduling status of each and, if not, how they feel it should be scheduled.


Results
715 pharmacists completed the survey, 462 from Ontario and 253 from Québec. Most were staff pharmacists working 30 or more hours per week, having been a pharmacist for 1-10 years. Ontario pharmacists expressed a preference for scheduling change for five drugs (four prescription [terconazole for intravaginal use, famotidine, rupatadine, mometasone nasal spray] and one unscheduled [ranitidine 75 mg]), while Québec pharmacists expressed preference for scheduling change for three prescription drugs (terconazole for intravaginal use, famotidine, rupatadine).


Discussion
As pharmacy practice continues to evolve, pharmacists' comfort with initiating previously prescription-only therapy independently or assisting patients with self-selection may similarly evolve. Of the five drugs identified as having a discrepancy between current status and pharmacist preference, four are prescription and may be candidates to consider for prescription to OTC switch.


Conclusion
Pharmacists in Ontario and Québec have expressed preference for most products used in the treatment of allergic rhinitis, heartburn, and vulvovaginitis to be categorised as Schedule II (BTC) or Schedule III (OTC) available only in pharmacies.",10.1080/20523211.2024.2385936

For this, we evaluated the effects of the complex fermented milk (Y44-CFM), obtained through the cofermentation of cow's milk and soybean milk with L. plantarum Y44 and traditional starters, on high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6 mice. Our study found that the oral administration of Y44-CFM significantly reduced body weight gain and hepatic lipid accumulation in HFD-fed mice while also mitigating liver injury. Additionally, Y44-CFM regulated the expression of enzymes associated with lipid metabolism in the serum, as well as the corresponding or related genes in the liver, such as fatty acid synthase. Furthermore, HFD-induced systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and intestinal barrier dysfunction were improved. The primary alterations in hepatic metabolism involved glycerophospholipids and amino acids, including the biosynthesis of valine, leucine, and isoleucine. The diversity and overall structure of the gut microbiota were also regulated, resulting in a significant decrease in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F/B) and unclassified_f_Lachnospiraceae, along with a notable increase in Oscillospiraceae. The correlation analysis indicated that Y44-CFM influenced hepatic lipid metabolism by mediating intestinal flora and its production of short-chain fatty acids, ultimately leading to weight reduction.",10.1021/acs.jafc.4c08671

Hemostatic materials have been developed over the last decades to address this issue, nevertheless these materials alone do not contribute to improve the survival effects in many extreme conditions, which is usually caused by penetrating arterial bleeding wounds that are incompressible and deep arterial bleeding with irregularly shapes. It is well known that, after calcium ion stimulation, many intriguing changes occurred in the major components of plasma, including the activation of several coagulation factors, such as the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, prothrombin to thrombin, and so on. Therefore, we constructed an expansion sponge with interpenetrating network based on chitosan and plasma, while various activated coagulation factors in plasma were also loaded into the pore structure of chitosan sponges. The prepared CS-PG sponge is capable of providing a simpler and more efficient method for treating high-pressure arterial bleeding wounds, which includes three steps: Rapid sealing and adhension, Thrombin catalysis and Activated autocoagulation.

"Concentrations of urinary metals, including arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), Antimony (Sb), barium (Ba), thallium (Tl), tungsten (W), uranium (U), were determined in urine using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry",Cadmium,Antimony,Cause-Effect,component-whole,Independent and combined associations of urinary metals exposure with markers of liver injury: Results from the NHANES 2013-2016.,"BACKGROUND
Heavy metals entering the human body could cause damage to a variety of organs. However, the combined harmful effects of exposure to various metals on liver function are not well understood. The purpose of the study was to investigate the independent and joint relationships between heavy metal exposure and liver function in adults.


METHODS
The study involved 3589 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Concentrations of urinary metals, including arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), barium (Ba), thallium (Tl), tungsten (W), uranium (U), were determined in urine using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Data for liver function biomarkers included alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transaminase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Survey-weighted linear regression and quantile g-computation (qgcomp) were employed to evaluate the relationship of urinary metals with the markers of liver injury.


RESULTS
Cd, U and Ba were found to have positive correlations with ALT, AST, GGT, and ALP in the survey-weighted linear regression analyses. According to the qgcomp analyses, the total metal mixture was positively correlated with ALT (percent change: 8.15; 95% CI: 3.84, 12.64), AST (percent change: 5.55; 95% CI: 2.39, 8.82), GGT (percent change: 14.30; 95% CI: 7.81, 21.18), and ALP (percent change: 5.59; 95% CI: 2.65, 8.62), and Cd, U, and Ba were the main contributors to the combined effects. Positive joint effects were observed between Cd and U on ALT, AST, GGT and ALP, and U and Ba had positive joint effects on ALT, AST and GGT.


CONCLUSION
Exposures to Cd, U, and Ba were individually associated with multiple markers of liver injury. Mixed metal exposure might be adversely correlated with markers of liver function. The findings indicated the potential harmful effect of metal exposure on liver function.",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.139455

Information regarding carbapenem-induced liver injury is limited, and the rate of liver injury caused by meropenem (MEPM) and doripenem (DRPM) remains unknown. Decision tree (DT) analysis, a machine learning method, has a flowchart-like model where users can easily predict the risk of liver injury. Thus, we aimed to compare the rate of liver injury between MEPM and DRPM and construct a flowchart that can be used to predict carbapenem-induced liver injury.


METHODS
We investigated patients treated with MEPM (n = 310) or DRPM (n = 320) and confirmed liver injury as the primary outcome. We used a chi-square automatic interaction detection algorithm to construct DT models. The dependent variable was set as liver injury from a carbapenem (MEPM or DRPM), and factors including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score, and concomitant use of acetaminophen were used as explanatory variables.


RESULTS
The rates of liver injury were 22.9% (71/310) and 17.5% (56/320) in the MEPM and DRPM groups, respectively; no significant differences in the rate were observed (95% confidence interval: 0.710-1.017). Although the DT model of MEPM could not be constructed, DT analysis showed that the incidence of introducing DRPM in patients with ALT >22 IU/L and ALBI scores > -1.87 might be high-risk.


CONCLUSIONS
The risk of developing liver injury did not differ significantly between the MEPM and DRPM groups. Since ALT and ALBI score are evaluated in clinical settings, this DT model is convenient and potentially useful for medical staff in assessing liver injury before DRPM administration.",10.1016/j.jiac.2023.03.007

The results showed mitochondria was damaged and excessive reactive Oxygen species (ROS) were generated in Chicken liver cell line LMH after cadmium exposure,Oxygen,Chicken,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,From inflammation to pyroptosis: Understanding the consequences of cadmium exposure in chicken liver cells.,"Hepatotoxicity is frequently observed following acute cadmium (Cd) exposure in chicken. Oxidative stress and subsequent inflammation are regarded as the main reasons for cadmium-induced liver injury. NOD-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-induced pyroptosis is involved in various inflammatory diseases, including liver injury. Poultry are more susceptible to harmful effects of heavy metals. However, the mechanism of cadmium-induced liver injury in chicken is still elusive. In this study, the effect of cadmium on chicken liver cells and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. The results showed mitochondria was damaged and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) were generated in chicken liver cell line LMH after cadmium exposure. Furthermore, cadmium-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the cell membrane rupture indicated LMH cells pyroptosis. The ROS scavengers, acetylcysteine (NAC) and Mito-TEMPO prevented pyroptosis in LMH cells, suggesting that ROS were responsible for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome induced by cadmium. Additionally, anti-oxidative transcription factor Nrf2 was inhibited after cadmium exposure, explaining the excessive ROS generation. In summary, our study showed that cadmium leads to ROS generation by inducing mitochondrial damage and inhibiting Nrf2 activity, which promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation and eventually induces pyroptosis in LMH cells.",10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116004

To identify potential biomarkers for anthracycline-induced hepatotoxicity (AIH), we generated clinically-relevant mouse and rat models administered low-dose, long-term DOX. These models exhibited significant liver damage but no decline in cardiac function. Through untargeted metabolic profiling of the liver, we identified 27 differential metabolites in a mouse model and 28 in a rat model. We then constructed a metabolite-metabolite network for each animal model and computationally identified several potential metabolic markers, with particular emphasis on aromatic amino acids, including phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. We further performed targeted metabolomics analysis on DOX-treated 4T1 breast cancer mice for external validation. We found significant (p < 0.001) reductions in hepatic levels of phenylalanine and tyrosine (but not tryptophan) following DOX treatment, which were strongly correlated with serum aminotransferases (ALT and AST) levels.

"In the liver and testicular tissue, Sildenafil citrate treatment resulted in significant reductions in catalase and total antioxidant capacity; as well as increased malondialdehyde, reactive Oxygen species, and nitrous oxide levels",Sildenafil,Oxygen,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Ameliorative effect of hesperidin against high dose sildenafil-induced liver and testicular oxidative stress and altered gene expression in male rats.,"BACKGROUND
The clinical use of sildenafil citrate (Viagra), a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction, is limited because of its many side effects on tissues. In this context, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of hesperidin, a citrus flavonoid, on hepatic and testicular damage induced by a high dose of sildenafil citrate in male rats. Rats were randomly divided into four groups. The first group was used as the control group. The second group was orally administered sildenafil citrate at a high dose of 75 mg/kg thrice a week. In the third group, hesperidin was administered orally at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day. The fourth group was administered 75 mg/kg sildenafil citrate three times a week with 50 mg/kg hesperidin daily. The experiment lasted for 28 days.


RESULTS
In the sildenafil-treated groups, blood indices were altered, liver function tests were deranged, and serum testosterone levels were reduced. In the liver and testicular tissue, sildenafil citrate treatment resulted in significant reductions in catalase and total antioxidant capacity; as well as increased malondialdehyde, reactive oxygen species, and nitrous oxide levels. In addition, sildenafil citrate treatment caused abnormal histopathological patterns in both the liver and the testes. Liver vascular endothelial growth factor and testicular steroidogenic acute regulatory protein gene expression were upregulated.


CONCLUSIONS
Hesperidin attenuated the harmful effects of intensive sildenafil citrate treatment on liver and testicular functions, alleviated oxidative stress and normalized blood indices. Therefore, hesperidin could be protective against sildenafil citrate-induced oxidative damage that may develop over the long term.",10.1186/s42826-023-00173-4

Inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs), composed of an inositol ring decorated with monophosphate and diphosphate moieties, and inorganic polyphosphate (polyP), chains of orthophosphate residues linked by phosphoanhydride bonds, are energy-rich biomolecules that play critical roles in phosphate homeostasis. There is a complex interplay between these two phosphate-rich molecules, and they share an interdependent relationship with cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). In eukaryotes, the enzymes involved in PP-InsP synthesis show some degree of conservation across species, whereas distinct enzymology exists for polyP synthesis among different organisms. In fact, the mechanism of polyP synthesis in metazoans, including mammals, is still unclear. Early studies on PP-InsP and polyP synthesis were conducted in the slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum, but it is in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that a clear understanding of the interplay between polyP, PP-InsPs, and Pi homeostasis has now been established. Recent research has shed more light on the influence of PP-InsPs on polyP in mammals, and the regulation of both these molecules by cellular ATP and Pi levels. In this review we will discuss the cross-talk between PP-InsPs, polyP, ATP, and Pi in the context of budding yeast, slime mould, and mammals. We will also highlight the similarities and differences in the relationship between these phosphate-rich biomolecules among this group of organisms.",10.1042/BST20230256

Removal techniques are therefore required to purify water before use. Herein, we concentrate on adsorptive removal of TCC and SDZ using cobalt@carbon nanotubes (Co@CNTs) derived from Co-ZIF-67. The presence of CNTs on the edge of nanocomposites was observed. Taguchi orthogonal array was designed with four variables including initial concentration (5-20 mg L-1), dosage (0.05-0.2 g L-1), time (60-240 min), and pH (2-10). Concentration and pH were found to be main contributors to adsorption of tetracycline and sulfadiazine, respectively. The optimum condition was found at concentration 5 mg L-1, dosage 0.2 g L-1, contact time 240 min, and pH 7 for both TCC and SDZ removals. Confirmation tests showed that Co@CNTs-700 removed 99.6% of TCC and 97.3% of SDZ with small errors (3-5.5%). Moreover, the kinetic and isotherm were studied, which kinetic and isotherm data were best fitted with pseudo second-order model and Langmuir. Maximum adsorption capacity values for TCC and SDZ were determined at 118.4-174.1 mg g-1 for 180 min. We also proposed the main role of interactions such as hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and electrostatic attraction in the adsorption of antibiotics.

"METHODS
The reversal potential of andexanet alfa, various 4F-PCCs, and activated PCC was investigated ex vivo in human blood anticoagulated with Rivaroxaban (37.5, 75, 150, and 300 ng ml-1) using a panel of coagulation parameters, including conventional coagulation assays, Thrombin generation, and a newly developed viscoelastometric device",Rivaroxaban,Thrombin,Component-Whole,cause-effect,Comparative analysis of andexanet alfa and prothrombin complex concentrate in reversing anticoagulation by rivaroxaban ex vivo.,"BACKGROUND
The comparative effectiveness of the specific antidote andexanet alfa vs the nonspecific therapy four-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (4F-PCCs) as reversal agents for direct factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors in severely bleeding patients is unclear. We hypothesised that specific reversal using andexanet alfa would be more effective than a high dose of PCC (50 IU kg-1) for reversing the FXa inhibitor rivaroxaban.


METHODS
The reversal potential of andexanet alfa, various 4F-PCCs, and activated PCC was investigated ex vivo in human blood anticoagulated with rivaroxaban (37.5, 75, 150, and 300 ng ml-1) using a panel of coagulation parameters, including conventional coagulation assays, thrombin generation, and a newly developed viscoelastometric device. We simulated in vivo conditions of coagulation activation and fibrin formation using flow chamber experiments of thrombogenicity potential under arterial flow conditions.


RESULTS
The 4F-PCCs normalised clotting profiles only at low rivaroxaban concentrations, whereas andexanet alfa and activated PCC significantly shortened clotting time at all rivaroxaban concentrations. Only andexanet alfa restored thrombin generation to baseline. Flow chamber results showed that various 4F-PCCs concentration-dependently restored clot formation.


CONCLUSIONS
In contrast to thrombin generation measurements, haemostatic reversal of rivaroxaban using high-dose 4F-PCCs exhibited similar efficacy as andexanet alfa in flow chamber experiments. The haemostatic effects of 4F-PCCs and andexanet alfa in the context of bleeding patients taking FXa inhibitors requires further study.",10.1016/j.bja.2023.10.018
"During clotting under flow, Thrombin rapidly generates Fibrin, whereas fibrin potently sequesters thrombin",Thrombin,Fibrin,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Investigating thrombin-loaded fibrin in whole blood clot microfluidic assay via fluorogenic peptide.,"During clotting under flow, thrombin rapidly generates fibrin, whereas fibrin potently sequesters thrombin. This co-regulation was studied using microfluidic whole blood clotting on collagen/tissue factor, followed by buffer wash, and a start/stop cycling flow assay using the thrombin fluorogenic substrate, Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-AMC. After 3 min of clotting (100 s-1) and 5 min of buffer wash, non-elutable thrombin activity was easily detected during cycles of flow cessation. Non-elutable thrombin was similarly detected in plasma clots or arterial whole blood clots (1000 s-1). This thrombin activity was ablated by Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone (PPACK), apixaban, or Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro to inhibit fibrin. Reaction-diffusion simulations predicted 108 nM thrombin within the clot. Heparin addition to the start/stop assay had little effect on fibrin-bound thrombin, whereas addition of heparin-antithrombin (AT) required over 6 min to inhibit the thrombin, indicating a substantial diffusion limitation. In contrast, heparin-AT rapidly inhibited thrombin within microfluidic plasma clots, indicating marked differences in fibrin structure and functionality between plasma clots and whole blood clots. Addition of GPVI-Fab to blood before venous or arterial clotting (200 or 1000 s-1) markedly reduced fibrin-bound thrombin, whereas GPVI-Fab addition after 90 s of clotting had no effect. Perfusion of AF647-fibrinogen over washed fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-fibrin clots resulted in an intense red layer around, but not within, the original FITC-fibrin. Similarly, introduction of plasma/AF647-fibrinogen generated substantial red fibrin masses that did not penetrate the original green clots, demonstrating that fibrin cannot be re-clotted with fibrinogen. Overall, thrombin within fibrin is non-elutable, easily accessed by peptides, slowly accessed by average-sized proteins (heparin/AT), and not accessible to fresh fibrinogen.",10.1016/j.bpj.2023.01.008

Thus, the choice of anticoagulant prophylaxis for this patient population is challenging. We investigated the in vitro effect of low-molecular-weight heparin (dalteparin) and direct thrombin inhibitor (argatroban) on the hemostasis in blood from sepsis patients with new-onset thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia was defined as a platelet count drop of ≥30% and/or from >100 × 10 9 /L to 30 to 100 × 10 9 /L within 24 hours prior to inclusion. We included five healthy individuals and ten patients. Analyses of thrombin generation (Calibrated Automated Thrombogram), thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex levels, prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2), and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) were performed. Based on dose-response relationships investigated in healthy blood, patient samples were spiked with prophylactic (0.25 IU/mL) and therapeutic (0.75 IU/mL) dalteparin and low (0.25 µg/mL) and high (0.50 µg/mL) argatroban concentrations, each with a sample without anticoagulant. In patients, the endogenous thrombin potential was markedly lower in therapeutic dalteparin samples than in samples without anticoagulant [median (range): 29 (0-388) vs. 795 (98-2121) nM × min]. In high argatroban concentration samples, thrombin lag time was longer than in samples without anticoagulant [median (range): 15.5 (10.5-20.2) versus 5.3 (2.8-7.3) min]. Dalteparin and argatroban both increased clotting time but did not affect maximum clot firmness in the ROTEM INTEM assay. Six patients had elevated TAT and eight patients had elevated F1 + 2. In conclusion, dalteparin mainly affected the amount of thrombin generated and argatroban delayed clot initiation in critically ill sepsis patients with new-onset thrombocytopenia. Neither anticoagulant affected clot strength.",10.1055/a-2000-6576
"In the present meta-analysis, we assessed the efficacy and safety of three second-generation broad-spectrum antiseizure medications, lamotrigine (LTG), levetiracetam (LEV), and Topiramate (TPM), and two third-generation broad-spectrum antiseizure medications, Perampanel (PER) and lacosamide (LCM), for the adjunctive treatment of refractory epilepsy",Topiramate,Perampanel,Component-Whole,component-whole,Efficacy and Safety of Five Broad-Spectrum Antiseizure Medications for Adjunctive Treatment of Refractory Epilepsy: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND
Overall, up to one-third of epilepsy patients have drug-resistant epilepsy. However, there was previously no meta-analysis to support the guidelines for broad-spectrum antiseizure medication selection for the adjunctive treatment of refractory epilepsy. In the present meta-analysis, we assessed the efficacy and safety of three second-generation broad-spectrum antiseizure medications, lamotrigine (LTG), levetiracetam (LEV), and topiramate (TPM), and two third-generation broad-spectrum antiseizure medications, perampanel (PER) and lacosamide (LCM), for the adjunctive treatment of refractory epilepsy.


METHODS
We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL from inception to July 15, 2022. The studies included in the meta-analysis were required to meet the following criteria: (1) be randomized, double-blind clinical trials; (2) include patients aged >2 years with a clinical diagnosis of drug-resistant epilepsy; (3) have at least 8 weeks for the treatment period excluding the titration phase; and (4) report the outcomes of seizure response, seizure freedom and the withdrawal rate due to treatment-emergent adverse effects. Data were extracted, and the risk of bias for each study was assessed by two authors independently using RoB2 tools. We performed the network meta-analysis for each outcome through a group of programs in the mvmeta and network packages in Stata. Relative odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated as the result of the analyses. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) and mean ranks were used to rank these treatments.


RESULTS
Forty-two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (LTG-placebo: n = 6, LEV-placebo: n = 13, TPM-placebo: n = 9, PER-placebo: n = 6, LCM-placebo: n = 7, LEV-TPM: n = 1) with 10257 participants (LTG = 569, LEV = 1626, TPM = 701, PER = 1734, LCM = 1908, placebo = 3719) were included. Levetiracetam had subequal efficacy in 50 % seizure frequency reduction to TPM [odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73-1.38], and LEV had a higher rate of ≥ 50% seizure frequency reduction than LCM (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.11-2.01) and PER (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.24-2.29). Levetiracetam was also related to a higher proportion of seizure freedom participants than TPM (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.20-2.89), PER (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.12-4.43), and LCM (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.46-6.05). In addition, LEV was associated with a lower risk of experiencing at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) than PER (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46-0.85) and TPM (OR 0.51, 95 % CI 0.36-0.72) and a lower proportion of patients experiencing TEAEs leading to discontinuation than PER (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-0.97) and TPM (OR 0.50, 95 % CI 0.27-0.93).


CONCLUSIONS
Third-generation drugs (PER and LCM) had no advantages in terms of efficacy and safety for adjunctive treatment of refractory epilepsy compared with several second-generation drugs (LEV and LTG). Levetiracetam was the priority choice for adjunctive treatment of refractory epilepsy. Perampanel and LCM had no advantages in terms of efficacy and safety among the five drugs.

However, whether l-theanine has an excellent preventive effect on depression in children and adolescents and what its mechanism is have not been well explained. Given the complexity of the pathogenesis of depression, this study investigated the preventive effect and mechanism of l-theanine on depression in juvenile rats by combining serum and hippocampal metabolomic strategies. Behavioral tests, hippocampal tissue sections, and serum and hippocampal biochemical indexes were studied, and the results confirmed the preventive effect of l-theanine. Untargeted reversed-phase liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and targeted hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry were developed to analyze the metabolism changes in the serum and hippocampus to screen for potential biomarkers related to l-theanine treatment. The results suggested that 28 abnormal metabolites in the serum and hippocampus that were considered as potential biomarkers returned to near-normal levels after l-theanine administration. These biomarkers were involved in various metabolic pathways, mainly including amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism. The levels of amino acids and neurotransmitters in the phenylalanine, tryptophan, and glutamic acid pathways were significantly reduced after l-theanine administration compared with chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced rats. In summary, l-theanine had a significant preventive effect on depression and achieved its preventive results on depression by regulating various aspects of the body, such as amino acids, lipids, and inflammation. This research systematically analyzed the mechanism of l-theanine in preventing depression and laid the foundation for applying l-theanine to prevent depression in children and adolescents.",10.1016/j.jpha.2022.10.001

Although alterations in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission in the brain play a role in depression, the precise molecular mechanisms in these neurotransmission underlying ketamine's antidepressant actions remain largely unknown. Mice exposed to FSS (forced swimming stress) showed depression-like behavior and decreased levels of GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid), but not glutamate, in the hippocampus. Ketamine increased GABA levels and decreased glutamate levels in the hippocampus of mice exposed to FSS. There was a correlation between GABA levels and depression-like behavior. Furthermore, ketamine increased the levels of enzymes and transporters on the GABAergic neurons (SAT1, GAD67, GAD65, VGAT and GAT1) and astrocytes (EAAT2 and GAT3), without affecting the levels of enzymes and transporters (SAT2, VGluT1 and GABAAR γ2) on glutamatergic neurons. Moreover, ketamine caused a decreased expression of GABAAR α1 subunit, which was specifically expressed on GABAergic neurons and astrocytes, an increased GABA synthesis and metabolism in GABAergic neurons, a plasticity change in astrocytes, and an increase in ATP (adenosine triphosphate) contents. Finally, GABAAR antagonist bicuculline or ATP exerted a rapid antidepressant-like effect whereas pretreatment with GABAAR agonist muscimol blocked the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine. In addition, pharmacological activation and inhibition of GABAAR modulated the synthesis and metabolism of GABA, and the plasticity of astrocytes in the hippocampus. The present data suggest that ketamine could increase GABA synthesis and astrocyte plasticity through downregulation of GABAAR α1, increases in GABA, and conversion of GABA into ATP, resulting in a rapid-acting antidepressant-like action.

"Fluoxetine and Sertraline, two Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are among the most prescribed antidepressants worldwide",Sertraline,Serotonin,Component-Whole,component-whole,In vitro effects of antidepressants on human sperm function.,"Depression currently affects about 280 million people worldwide and its prevalence has been increasing dramatically, especially among the young and people of reproductive age, which consequently leads to an increase in antidepressant consumption. Antidepressants are associated with sexual dysfunction in both men and women; however, their role in male fertility has been scarcely studied. Fluoxetine and sertraline, two serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are among the most prescribed antidepressants worldwide. To determine their possible effects, human sperm cells were exposed to either sertraline or fluoxetine at concentrations previously found in blood and seminal fluid of patients undergoing treatment. Spermatozoa were incubated for up to 24 h at 37°C and 5% CO 2 , and important functional parameters such as sperm motility, viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, chromatin/DNA integrity, acrosome status, and tyrosine phosphorylation were assessed. At low levels, fluoxetine consistently decreased progressive motility throughout time while promoting fluctuations in ROS levels and sperm capacitation. Nevertheless, it did not affect viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, acrosome reaction nor chromatin/DNA integrity. Sertraline, on the other hand, had little to nonsignificant impact at low doses, but affected almost all tested parameters at supratherapeutic concentrations. Altogether, our results suggest that both antidepressants may impair sperm function, possibly through different mechanisms of action, but fluoxetine is the only exhibiting mild negative effects at doses found in vivo .",10.4103/aja202459
"In this study, we tested the susceptibility of radish (Raphanus sativus) to colonization by different HPMOs, including Escherichia coli PCM 2561, Salmonella enterica subsp",Raphanus sativus,Escherichia coli,Component-Whole,cause-effect,Colonization of Raphanus sativus by human pathogenic microorganisms.,"Contamination of vegetables with human pathogenic microorganisms (HPMOs) is considered one of the most important problems in the food industry, as current nutritional guidelines include increased consumption of raw or minimally processed organic vegetables due to healthy lifestyle promotion. Vegetables are known to be potential vehicles for HPMOs and sources of disease outbreaks. In this study, we tested the susceptibility of radish (Raphanus sativus) to colonization by different HPMOs, including Escherichia coli PCM 2561, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica PCM 2565, Listeria monocytogenes PCM 2191 and Bacillus cereus PCM 1948. We hypothesized that host plant roots containing bactericidal compounds are less prone to HPMO colonization than shoots and leaves. We also determined the effect of selected pathogens on radish growth to check host plant-microbe interactions. We found that one-week-old radish is susceptible to colonization by selected HPMOs, as the presence of the tested HPMOs was demonstrated in all organs of R. sativus. The differences were noticed 2 weeks after inoculation because B. cereus was most abundant in roots (log10 CFU - 2.54), S. enterica was observed exclusively in stems (log10 CFU - 3.15), and L. monocytogenes and E. coli were most abundant in leaves (log10 CFU - 4.80 and 3.23, respectively). The results suggest that E. coli and L. monocytogenes show a higher ability to colonize and move across the plant than B. cereus and S. enterica. Based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) approach HPMOs were detected in extracellular matrix and in some individual cells of all analyzed organs. The presence of pathogens adversely affected the growth parameters of one-week-old R. sativus, especially leaf and stem fresh weight (decreased by 47-66 and 17-57%, respectively). In two-week-old plants, no reduction in plant biomass development was noted. This observation may result from plant adaptation to biotic stress caused by the presence of HPMOs, but confirmation of this assumption is needed. Among the investigated HPMOs, L. monocytogenes turned out to be the pathogen that most intensively colonized the aboveground part of R. sativus and at the same time negatively affected the largest number of radish growth parameters.",10.3389/fmicb.2024.1296372

The annual incidence of hypertension in young transgender men (1.18%) seemed comparable to that of the general population. In young transgender women, it seemed higher (2.14%); we found that the choice of androgen blocker had a remarkable effect, with a highly significant increase in patients treated with cyproterone acetate (4.90%) vs. the rest (0.80%); the adjusted hazard-ratio was 0.227 (p = 0.001). Correlation, logistic regression and mediation analyses were performed for the associations of the available clinical variables with the increase in systolic blood pressure and the onset of hypertension, but besides the use of cyproterone acetate, only the ponderal gain was found significant (Spearman's r: 0.361, p < 0.001); with a 36.7% mediation effect (31.2-42.3%). Cyproterone acetate has additional known risks, such as meningioma; although we cannot conclusively prove that it has a role in the development of hypertension, we conclude that the use of cyproterone acetate for this indication should be reconsidered.",10.1038/s41440-022-01067-z

Our investigation aimed to explore both the lethal and sub-lethal toxicity of clove oil under laboratory and field conditions, with the goal of elucidating the mechanisms underlying its toxic effects on E. vermiculata. Snails were exposed to various concentrations of clove oil for one week to determine the LC50, which was calculated to be 5.25% v/v (4.029-6.087). To investigate the molluscicidal effects of clove oil, snails were divided into three groups: control, vehicle-treated (1 % Tween 80), and treated group exposed to sub-lethal concentration (½ LC₅₀) of clove oil for one week. Compared to the control group, the exposure to ½ LC₅₀ of clove oil for 7 days resulted in significant increases in alkaline phosphatase (ALP), malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Conversely, the level of acetylecholnstrase (AChE) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was decreased. Furthermore, testosterone (T) and estrogen (E) levels were significantly reduced. Histological and ultrastructural studies revealed significant tissue disorganization. Additionally, Comet assay results confirmed the genotoxic potential of clove oil on E. vermiculata. Field trials demonstrated a higher reduction in snail populations in plots treated with methomyl (80% and 92% reduction after 7 and 14 days, respectively) compared to those treated with clove oil (64% and 73% reduction, respectively). While slightly less effective than methomyl, clove oil offers a valuable, natural, and residue-free alternative for eco-friendly snail management.",10.1016/j.toxicon.2024.108217

In pediatrics, shunt infection is considered the most common complication of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt insertion and the main cause of shunt failure. Careful surgical technique and hygienic skin preparations are highly important for prevention of shunt infections. Our objective was to assess the significance of using preoperative chlorhexidine/alcohol as a skin antiseptic in reducing the infection rate in pediatric VP shunts surgery.


METHODS
We conducted a retrospective, case control study of 80 pediatric patients with active hydrocephalus. The control group (a single step of preoperative skin antisepsis using povidone-iodine and isopropyl alcohol) comprised 40 patients who underwent a shunt surgery between January 2019 and June 2020 and the study group (two steps of preoperative skin antisepsis using 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% isopropyl alcohol as a first step followed by povidone-iodine as a second step) comprised 40 patients who underwent a shunt surgery between July 2020 and January 2022.


RESULTS
Shunt infection was encountered in 11 (13.7%) patients. It was significantly higher in preterm babies (p = 0.010), patients with a previous shunt revision (p < 0.001), and those with a previous shunt infection (p < 0.001). The incidence of infection was 22.5% in the control group and 5% in study group, with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.023).


CONCLUSIONS
Two steps of preoperative skin antisepsis, first using chlorhexidine/alcohol and then povidone-iodine scrub solution, may significantly reduce the infection rate in pediatric VP shunt surgeries.",10.1055/a-2265-9325

Olaparib, niraparib, and rucaparib are the three primary poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors that are currently available in the market. Previous studies indicate different incidences of adverse events based on the PARP inhibitor or country.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
This study used data from the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System collected between January 2018 and December 2023. The data analyzed in this study involved patients receiving PARP inhibitors for treating ovarian cancer. A comparative analysis of the three PARP inhibitors was conducted using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and the adjusted ROR (aROR) controlling for patient background differences.


RESULTS
The aROR for niraparib was significant at > 1.000, including platelet count decreased (p < 0.001) and thrombocytopenia (p < 0.001) when olaparib was set as the reference. Conversely, the aROR for niraparib was significant at < 1.000, including anemia (p < 0.001). Additionally, significant differences were observed in various adverse events for rucaparib. Moreover, significant differences were observed when comparing between countries.


CONCLUSIONS
This study indicates that the types of adverse events may vary by PARP inhibitor and by country. These results will be beneficial in clinical practice.",10.1080/14740338.2024.2418333
Polyamines are aliphatic Nitrogen-containing compounds that play important roles in disease resistance and are synthesized primarily by two pathways: an Arginine decarboxylation pathway and an ornithine decarboxylation pathway,Nitrogen,Arginine,Component-Whole,component-whole,Identification and Characterization of Polyamine Metabolism in Citrus in Response to 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' Infection.,"Citrus Huanglongbing, one of the most devastating citrus diseases, is caused by 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' (CLas). Polyamines are aliphatic nitrogen-containing compounds that play important roles in disease resistance and are synthesized primarily by two pathways: an arginine decarboxylation pathway and an ornithine decarboxylation pathway. However, it is unclear whether polyamines play a role in the tolerance of citrus to infection by CLas and, if so, whether one or both of the core polyamine metabolic pathways are important. We used high-performance liquid chromatography and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry to detect the contents of nine polyamine metabolism-related compounds in six citrus cultivars with varying levels of tolerance to CLas. We also systematically detected the changes in polyamine metabolism-related compounds and H2O2 contents and compared the gene expression levels and the activities of enzymes involved in the polyamine metabolic pathway among healthy, asymptomatic, and symptomatic leaves of Newhall navel oranges infected with CLas. The tolerant and moderately tolerant varieties showed higher polyamine metabolism-related compound levels than those of susceptible varieties. Compared with the healthy group, the symptomatic group showed significantly increased contents of arginine, ornithine, γ-aminobutyric acid, and putrescine by approximately 180, 19, 1.5, and 0.2 times, respectively, and upregulated expression of biosynthetic genes. Arginase and ornithine decarboxylase enzyme activities were the highest in the symptomatic group, whereas arginine decarboxylase and agmatine deiminase enzyme activities were the highest in the asymptomatic group. The two polyamine biosynthetic pathways showed different trends with the increase of the CLas titer, indicating that polyamines were mainly synthesized through the arginine decarboxylase pathway in the asymptomatic leaves and were synthesized via the ornithine decarboxylase pathway in symptomatic leaves. These findings provide new insight into the changes in polyamine metabolism in citrus infected with CLas.",10.1094/PHYTO-04-23-0114-R
Molecular Oxygen was identified as an additional electron acceptor resulting in wasteful electrons from NADPH for the main catalysis,Oxygen,NADPH,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Heterologous Expression and Characterization of a Full-length Protozoan Nitroreductase from Leishmania orientalis isolate PCM2.,"Leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease found in parts of the tropics and subtropics, is caused by Leishmania protozoa infection. Nitroreductases (NTRs), enzymes involved in nitroaromatic prodrug activation, are attractive targets for leishmaniasis treatment development. In this study, a full-length recombinant NTR from the Leishmania orientalis isolate PCM2 (LoNTR), which causes severe leishmaniasis in Thailand, was successfully expressed in soluble form using chaperone co-expression in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The purified histidine-tagged enzyme (His6-LoNTR) had a subunit molecular mass of 36 kDa with no cofactor bound; however, the addition of exogenous flavin (either FMN or FAD) readily increased its enzyme activity. Bioinformatics analysis found that the unique N-terminal sequences of LoNTR is only present in Leishmania where the addition of this region might result in the loss of flavin binding. Either NADH or NADPH can serve as an electron donor to transfer electrons to nitrofurazone; however, NADPH was preferred. Molecular oxygen was identified as an additional electron acceptor resulting in wasteful electrons from NADPH for the main catalysis. Steady-state kinetic experiments revealed a ping-pong mechanism for His6-LoNTR with Km,NADPH, Km,NFZ, and kcat of 28 µM, 68 µM, and 0.84 min-1, respectively. Besides nitroreductase activity, His6-LoNTR also has the ability to reduce quinone derivatives. The properties of full-length His6-LoNTR were different from previously reported protozoa and bacterial NTRs in many respects. This study provides information of NTR catalysis to be developed as a potential future therapeutic target to treat leishmaniasis.",10.1007/s12033-022-00556-3

Herein, nanoengineered human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs), named PMZMU, are designed as a sonosensitizer for synergistic sonodynamic-nano-antimicrobial therapy against gram-negative XDR bacteria. PMZMU is composed of a bacterial targeting peptide (UBI29-41) modified hUC-MSCs membrane (MSCm), a sonosensitizer meso-tetra(4-car-boxyphenyl) porphine doped mesoporous organo-silica nanoparticle and an acidity-responsive metal-organic framework ZIF-8. This innovative formulation enables efficient loading of polymyxin B, reduces off-target drug release, increases circulation and targeting efficacy, and generates reactive oxygen species upon ultrasound irradiation. PMZMU exhibits remarkable in vitro inhibitory activity against four XDR bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), and Escherichia coli. Taking advantage of the bacterial targeting ability of UBI29-41 and the inflammatory chemotaxis of hUC-MSC, PMZMU can be precisely delivered to lung infection sites thereby augmenting polymyxin B concentration. PMZMU-mediated sonodynamic therapy significantly reduces bacterial burden, relieves inflammatory damage by promoting the polarization of macrophages toward M2 phenotype, and improves survival rates without introducing adverse events. Overall, this study offers promising strategies for treating deep-tissue XDR bacterial infections, and guides the design and optimization of biomimetic nanomedicine.",10.1002/advs.202402473

"Most studies used carboplatin (17 studies) followed by Cisplatin (two), and Lobaplatin (one)",Cisplatin,Lobaplatin,Component-Whole,cause-effect,Platinum-based chemotherapy for early triple-negative breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer associated with shorter survival and a higher likelihood of the cancer returning. In early TNBC, platinum-based chemotherapy has been shown to improve pathological complete response (pCR); however, its effect on long-term survival outcomes has not been fully elucidated and recommendations to include platinum chemotherapy are not consistent in international guidelines.


OBJECTIVES
To evaluate the benefits and harms of platinum-based chemotherapy as adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment in people with early triple-negative breast cancer.


SEARCH METHODS
We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 4 April 2022.


SELECTION CRITERIA
We included randomised controlled trials examining neoadjuvant or adjuvant platinum chemotherapy for early TNBC.


DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS
We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Our secondary outcomes were pCR, treatment adherence, grade III or IV toxicity related to chemotherapy, and quality of life. Prespecified subgroups included BRCA mutation status, homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status, frequency of chemotherapy, type of platinum agent used, and the presence or absence of anthracycline chemotherapy. We assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's RoB 1 tool and certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.


MAIN RESULTS
From 3972 records, we included 20 published studies involving 21 treatment comparisons, and 25 ongoing studies. For most domains, risk of bias was low across studies. There were 16 neoadjuvant chemotherapy studies (one of which combined neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy) and four adjuvant chemotherapy trials. Most studies used carboplatin (17 studies) followed by cisplatin (two), and lobaplatin (one). Eight studies had an anthracycline-free intervention arm, five of which had a carboplatin-taxane intervention compared to an anthracycline-taxane control. All studies reporting DFS and OS used carboplatin. Inclusion of platinum chemotherapy improved DFS in neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings (neoadjuvant: hazard ratio (HR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.75; 7 studies, 8 treatment comparisons, 1966 participants; high-certainty evidence; adjuvant: HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.88; 4 studies, 1256 participants; high-certainty evidence). Platinum chemotherapy in the regimen improved OS (neoadjuvant: HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.86; 7 studies, 8 treatment comparisons, 1973 participants; high-certainty evidence; adjuvant: 0.70, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.96; 4 studies, 1256 participants; high-certainty evidence). Median follow-up for survival outcomes ranged from 36 to 97.6 months. Our analysis confirmed platinum chemotherapy increased pCR rates (risk ratio (RR) 1.44, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.59; 15 studies, 16 treatment comparisons, 3083 participants; high-certainty evidence). Subgroup analyses showed no evidence of differences in DFS according to BRCA mutation status, HRD status, lymph node status, or whether the intervention arm contained anthracycline chemotherapy or not. Platinum chemotherapy was associated with reduced dose intensity, with participants more likely to require chemotherapy delays (RR 2.23, 95% CI 1.70 to 2.94; 4 studies, 5 treatment comparisons, 1053 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), dose reductions (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.56 to 2.02; 7 studies, 8 treatment comparisons, 2055 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and early cessation of treatment (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.38; 16 studies, 17 treatment comparisons, 4178 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Increased haematological toxicity occurred in the platinum group who were more likely to experience grade III/IV neutropenia (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.43 to 1.63; 19 studies, 20 treatment comparisons, 4849 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), anaemia (RR 8.20, 95% CI 5.66 to 11.89; 18 studies, 19 treatment comparisons, 4757 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and thrombocytopenia (RR 7.59, 95% CI 5.10 to 11.29; 18 studies, 19 treatment comparisons, 4731 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between chemotherapy groups in febrile neutropenia (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.49; 11 studies, 3771 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Renal impairment was very rare (0.4%, 2 events in 463 participants; note 3 studies reported 0 events in both arms; 4 studies; high-certainty evidence). Treatment-related death was very rare (0.2%, 7 events in 3176 participants and similar across treatment groups; RR 0.58, 95% 0.14 to 2.33; 10 studies, 11 treatment comparisons; note 8 studies reported treatment-related deaths but recorded 0 events in both groups. Thus, the RR and CIs were calculated from 3 studies rather than 11; 3176 participants; high-certainty evidence). Five studies collected quality of life data but did not report them.


AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS
Platinum-based chemotherapy using carboplatin in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting improves long-term outcomes of DFS and OS in early TNBC, with no evidence of differences by subgroup. This was at the cost of more frequent chemotherapy delays and dose reductions, and greater haematological toxicity, though serious adverse events including neuropathy, febrile neutropenia or treatment-related death were not increased.

"A total of 80 piglets [(Landrace × Large White) × Duroc] of both sexes (a ratio of gilts and barrows; 1:1), were randomly allotted to four diet groups: positive control (PC) diet supplemented with 0.02% Amoxicillin; negative control (NC) diet without supplement addition; BSFL12 diet (NC + 12% BSFL full-fat meal); and BSFL + Pro diet (BSFL full-fat meal + 0.1% multi-probiotics, including Bacillus subtilis, B",Amoxicillin,Bacillus subtilis,Component-Whole,component-whole,"Dietary supplementation with full-fat Hermetia illucens larvae and multi-probiotics, as a substitute for antibiotics, improves the growth performance, gut health, and antioxidative capacity of weaned pigs.","BACKGROUND
Dietary supplementation of full-fat black soldier fly larvae (BSFL full-fat meal; alone or in combination with multi-probiotics) was tested as an alternative to dietary antibiotics in weaning piglets. We also tested the effects of these diets on growth performance, nutrient digestibility coefficients, immune status, oxidative stress, intestinal histomorphology, and rectal microbial modulations in weaned pigs. A total of 80 piglets [(Landrace × Large White) × Duroc] of both sexes (a ratio of gilts and barrows; 1:1), were randomly allotted to four diet groups: positive control (PC) diet supplemented with 0.02% amoxicillin; negative control (NC) diet without supplement addition; BSFL12 diet (NC + 12% BSFL full-fat meal); and BSFL + Pro diet (BSFL full-fat meal + 0.1% multi-probiotics, including Bacillus subtilis, B. licheniformis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). All groups had five replicates, with four piglets per replicate.


RESULTS
Dietary BSFL + Pro improved the overall average daily gain (P = 0.013), and gain-to-feed ratio (P = 0.032). The BSFL12 and BSFL + Pro diets improved nutrient digestibility and increased the serum levels of immunoglobulin A and glutathione peroxidase, while reducing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The spleen weight was higher and caecal pH was lower in pigs fed the BSFL + Pro diet than in those fed the NC diet (P = 0.011 and P = 0.021, respectively). Pigs fed the BSFL diets had longer duodenal villi, a higher villus height-to-crypt depth ratio (P = 0.004), and shorter crypt depth (P = 0.017) than those fed NC. The BSFL + Pro diet also increased faecal Lactobacillus spp. count (P = 0.008) and reduced Escherichia coli (P = 0.021) counts compared with that seen with PC and NC diets, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
Dietary supplementation with BSFL or BSFL + multi-probiotics can improve the growth performance and intestinal health of pigs and may be an effective strategy to replace antibiotics for weaned pigs.",10.1186/s12917-022-03550-8

"Meanwhile, HCH could increase reactive Oxygen species and thereby lead to mitochondrial depolarization and the down-regulation of Adenosine triphosphate levels",Oxygen,Adenosine,Cause-Effect,cause-effect,Hexachlorocyclohexane impairs human sperm motility by affecting lysine glutarylation and mitochondrial functions.,"Decreased sperm motility is a leading cause of male infertility and persistent organic pollutants are known to contribute significantly to the development of this disease. The effects of organochlorine pesticides such as hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) on human sperm function and their mechanisms of action have received much attention, but are still not fully understood. Herein, we discovered that HCH has a concentration- and time-dependent inhibitory effect on human sperm motility in vitro. Moreover, HCH could reduce the levels of lysine glutarylation (Kglu) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in sperm. Meanwhile, HCH could increase reactive oxygen species and thereby lead to mitochondrial depolarization and the down-regulation of adenosine triphosphate levels. In particular, we observed that sodium glutarate (Na-glu), the precursor of glutaryl-CoA, could alleviate the inhibitory effect of HCH on sperm Kglu levels, whereas the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) had no effect. Intriguingly, both Na-glu and NAC were able to partially inhibit the HCH-induced increase in sperm ROS levels and impaired sperm motility. In conclusion, we propose that HCH inhibits sperm Kglu, leading to the disruption of mitochondrial energy metabolism, which in turn adversely affects sperm motility.",10.1016/j.fct.2023.113991

This study aimed to explore Cucumeropsis mannii seed oil effects against mitochondrial damage in rats using bisphenol A. Forty-eight rats were randomly assigned to six groups (n = 6) of eight rats each and fed the same food and water for 6 weeks. The group A rats were given 1 mL olive oil, while the ones in group B were given bisphenol A at 100 mL/kg body weight via oral route. Group C received C. mannii seed oil 7.5 mL/kg body weight C. mannii seed oil, while group D, group E, and group F were pre-administered bisphenol A at 100 mL/kg body weight, followed by treatment with C. mannii seed oil at 7.5, 5, and 2.5 mL/kg body weight, respectively. Antioxidant enzymes, glutathione, reactive oxygen species, testicular volume, malondialdehyde, body weight, and testicular studies were done using standard methods. The results of the bisphenol A-administered group showed a significant decrease in the antioxidant enzymes, glutathione, body weight, and testicular volume with elevation in the levels of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, and testicular indices. BPA + CMSO-treated group showed a significant increase in GPx activity compared with BPA-exposed rats. CMSO treatment significantly increased catalase activity in comparison with that of rats exposed to BPA. Remarkably, C. mannii seed oil and bisphenol A co-administration significantly reversed the abnormalities observed in the dysregulated biochemical biomarkers. Our findings suggest that C. mannii seed oil has considerable antioxidant potential which can be explored in therapeutic development against systemic toxicity induced by exposure to bisphenol A.

The comparative effectiveness and safety of C-T versus CAZ-AVI remain unknown. A retrospective, multicenter cohort study was performed in six tertiary centers in Saudi Arabia and included patients who received either C-T or CAZ-AVI for infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa. Overall in-hospital mortality, 30-day mortality, and clinical cure were the main study outcomes. Safety outcomes were also evaluated. A multivariate analysis using logistic regression was used to determine the independent impact of treatment on the main outcomes of interest. We enrolled 200 patients in the study (100 in each treatment arm). A total of 56% were in the intensive care unit, 48% were mechanically ventilated, and 37% were in septic shock. Approximately 19% of patients had bacteremia. Combination therapy was administered to 41% of the patients. The differences between the C-T and CAZ-AVI groups did not reach statistical significance in the overall in-hospital mortality (44% versus 37%; P = 0.314; OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.76 to 2.36), 30-day mortality (27% versus 23%; P = 0.514; OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.65 to 2.35), clinical cure (61% versus 66%; P = 0.463; OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.49), or acute kidney injury (23% versus 17%; P = 0.289; OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 0.69 to 3.14), even after adjusting for differences between the two groups. C-T and CAZ-AVI did not significantly differ in terms of safety and effectiveness, and they serve as potential options for the treatment of infections caused by MDR P. aeruginosa.",10.1128/aac.00405-23

UPLC-MS and NMR spectroscopy were used to measure panels of lipoproteins, lipids, biogenic amines, amino acids, and tryptophan pathway metabolites in blood plasma samples collected from 152 patients within 48 h of admission into the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) where 62 patients had no sepsis, 71 patients had sepsis, and 19 patients had septic shock. Patients with sepsis or septic shock had higher concentrations of neopterin and lower levels of HDL cholesterol and phospholipid particles in comparison to nonsepsis patients. Septic shock could be differentiated from sepsis patients based on different concentrations of 10 lipids, including significantly lower concentrations of five phosphatidylcholine species, three cholesterol esters, one dihydroceramide, and one phosphatidylethanolamine. The Supramolecular Phospholipid Composite (SPC) was reduced in all ICU patients, while the composite markers of acute phase glycoproteins were increased in the sepsis and septic shock patients within 48 h admission into ICU.
